What a Rail actually is

A Rail is:

A global, time-derived, deterministic modulation signal that exists whether or not the patch references it.

That is the defining property.

Time, phaseA, phaseB, energy, pulse, palette are not “routing constructs”.
They are global carriers of temporal structure.

A Bus is user wiring.
A Rail is part of the simulation clock fabric.
