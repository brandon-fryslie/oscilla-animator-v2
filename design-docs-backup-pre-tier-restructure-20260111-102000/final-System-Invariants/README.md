This directory contains FINAL core design invariants.

The rest of the design docs can be considered WIP in some sense, in that there are some contradictions between newer and older docs
as we have evolved the design.  However, everything in this directory must be considered a core invariant that cannot
be violated.  Future work should be evaluated against these invariants as part of the DoD.
