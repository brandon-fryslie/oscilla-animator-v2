## Summary

Fixed missing timeRoot role assignment in the demo patch (src/main.ts).

## Changes

1. Added import: `import { timeRootRole } from './types';`
2. Updated InfiniteTimeRoot block creation to include role option:
   ```typescript
   const time = b.addBlock('InfiniteTimeRoot',
     { periodAMs: 16000, periodBMs: 32000 },
     { role: timeRootRole() }
   );
   ```

## Verification

- TypeScript typecheck passed
- Fix ensures Connection Matrix correctly filters out the time block
- Commit: 6c913f7 "fix(demo): assign timeRoot role to InfiniteTimeRoot block"

## Impact

The Connection Matrix component already had correct filtering logic for timeRoot blocks,
but the demo patch wasn't marking the InfiniteTimeRoot block with the proper role.
This fix ensures the time block is properly filtered from the connection matrix display.
