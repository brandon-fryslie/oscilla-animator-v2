Scope: work/buses-and-rails/unified-defaults
Verdict: INCOMPLETE
Criteria: 5/5 working | Breaks found: 0 | Ambiguities: 0
Previous issues: N/A (new work)
Missing checks: 0 specified
Cache updated: runtime-unified-defaults.md, INDEX.md

Details:
- All unified defaults DoD criteria met (Square block, type system, block defs, pass1, UI)
- 372/372 tests passing
- Old patterns completely removed
- TypeScript errors (4) are from OTHER unrelated work:
  * baseTauMs missing in test (continuity work, commit 1dde863)
  * SliderWithInput JSX errors (UI work, commit 7dd6027)
- Unified defaults commits (c16d945-2835774) predate these errors
- Implementation is functionally complete but codebase won't compile

Recommendation: Fix unrelated TypeScript errors, then unified defaults can ship
