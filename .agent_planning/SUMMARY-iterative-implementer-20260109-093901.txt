Status: complete

Summary:
Successfully replaced duplicate AxesDescIR type with canonical ResolvedExtent.
All IR types now use canonical vocabulary (cardinality, temporality, binding).
Single source of truth established in canonical-types.ts.

Implementation:
1. Added ResolvedExtent interface to canonical-types.ts (lines 359-378)
2. Added resolveExtent() function for default resolution
3. Deleted AxesDescIR from program.ts (removed ~50 lines of duplicate code)
4. Updated TypeDesc.axes to use ResolvedExtent
5. Simplified bridge.ts to use resolveExtent directly
6. Updated bridges.ts to return canonical types
7. Updated all tests to check canonical field names (cardinality, binding)

Verification:
- npm run typecheck: PASS
- npm run test: 123 tests PASS (0 failures)
- npm run build: PASS
- grep for AxesDescIR type definition: 0 matches (SUCCESS)

Vocabulary Mapping Applied:
- Old: domain = 'signal'/'field'/'value' → New: cardinality.kind = 'one'/'many'/'zero'
- Old: identity → New: binding (with referent structure preserved)
- temporality, perspective, branch: unchanged (direct mapping)

Files Modified:
- src/core/canonical-types.ts (+33 lines)
- src/compiler/ir/program.ts (-68 lines, removed duplicate)
- src/compiler/ir/bridge.ts (-100 lines, simplified)
- src/compiler/ir/bridges.ts (updated to use ResolvedExtent)
- src/compiler/ir/__tests__/bridges.test.ts (updated expectations)

Commit: 0b27621 "refactor(types): unify IR types with canonical ResolvedExtent"

Next Steps:
- TypeDesc now uses canonical ResolvedExtent
- All bridge functions simplified
- Ready for downstream consumers to use canonical vocabulary
