**Status:** APPROVED

- DOD-20260112-190000.md

## Approved Scope

### Sprint 1 (This Sprint)
- P0: Rete.js setup & basic rendering
- P1: Socket type system (mapped to SignalType)
- P2: OscillaNode class & block mapping
- P3: Bidirectional sync (PatchStore ↔ Rete)
- P4: Add block from Library (double-click)
- P5: Delete block via context menu

### Deferred to Sprint 2
- Undo/redo (History plugin)
- Auto-layout (Auto-arrange plugin)
- Minimap
- Custom node rendering

## Key Decisions
- PatchStore remains source of truth
- Rete is the UI layer, not replacing compiler
- Socket validation at authoring time; compiler validates at compile time
- Bidirectional sync with isSyncing guard to prevent loops

## Notes
- User explicitly wanted undo/redo removed from Sprint 1 scope
- Rete was chosen over React Flow for built-in socket validation, history plugin, and auto-layout
