Completed: Fixed all type errors in compilation pipeline | Files: 5 | Commits: 1
Status: complete

Summary:
Resolved all TypeScript type errors in the compilation pipeline. The main issues were:
- Event type mismatches (CompileBegin vs CompileStart)
- Type mismatches (string vs number for patchRevision)
- PayloadType errors ('r' is not valid, should be 'float')  
- Function signature mismatches (pass6 needs single param)
- Missing/incorrect imports (TypeDesc vs SignalType)
- Legacy code accessing non-existent properties on new SignalType

Changes made:
1. compile.ts: Fixed event types and patchRevision types
2. pass3-time.ts: Changed 'r' to 'float' for PayloadType
3. pass6-block-lowering.ts: Single parameter, removed legacy validation
4. combine-utils.ts: Added type cast for EventExprId
5. resolveWriters.ts: Fixed TypeDesc import to use SignalType

TypeScript now compiles with zero errors.

Next steps:
- Test compilation with actual patches
- Fix runtime issues if any
- Continue with remaining DoD items (P2: Implement Pass 7 and IR conversion)
