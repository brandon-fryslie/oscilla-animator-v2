## Testing Checklist

### Browser Console Verification
1. Launch dev server
2. Connect Chrome via MCP
3. Navigate to app
4. Open DevTools console
5. Filter for "mobx" warnings
6. Reload page → should be clean
7. Interact with canvas → should stay clean
8. Switch panels → should stay clean
9. Select blocks → should stay clean

### Functional Testing
1. Test zoom in/out via mouse wheel
2. Test pan via click-and-drag
3. Test view reset via double-click
4. Verify viewport state updates correctly
5. Verify no visual glitches

### Regression Testing
1. Run `npm run typecheck` → should pass
2. Run `npm run test` → should pass
3. Run `npm run build` → should succeed
4. Verify other components still work

## Success Criteria Summary

**DONE** means:
- ✅ Zero MobX warnings in console
- ✅ All canvas interactions functional
- ✅ TypeScript compiles clean
- ✅ Tests pass
- ✅ No regressions introduced

## Notes

- This is a focused fix for CanvasTab
- If additional unwrapped components are discovered, they can be addressed in a follow-up
- The fix should be minimal and surgical - just adding observer wrapper
- No refactoring or feature additions
