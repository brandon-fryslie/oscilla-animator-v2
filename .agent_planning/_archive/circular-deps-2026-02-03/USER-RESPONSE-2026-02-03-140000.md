# User Response: Circular Dependencies Plan Approval
Timestamp: 2026-02-03-140000

## Approval Status: APPROVED (with modifications)

User approved all 3 sprints with the following specifications:

### Sprint 1: test-reenable
**Status**: APPROVED as-is
- Proceed with removing test skip and verifying tests pass

### Sprint 2: boundary-enforcement
**Status**: APPROVED with modification
**User Direction**: "Implement both and I'll decide after trying them"
- Implement BOTH eslint-plugin-boundaries AND dependency-cruiser
- Configure both with the same rule set
- User will evaluate both and choose preferred tool after seeing them in action

### Sprint 3: architecture-eval
**Status**: APPROVED with constraints
**User Direction**: "option b: compiler should not depend on blocks, right? Do not make any changes for this, but present a plan"
- Focus analysis on Option B (strict one-way: compiler must not depend on blocks)
- Present a migration plan showing how to eliminate compiler -> blocks imports
- **NO CODE CHANGES** - research and planning only
- User recognizes this violates the current "compiler should not depend on blocks" architecture

## Implementation Order
1. Sprint 1 (test-reenable) - immediate implementation
2. Sprint 2 (boundary-enforcement) - implement both tools in parallel
3. Sprint 3 (architecture-eval) - research Option B migration plan only

## Notes
- Sprint 2: Both tools will be configured with identical rule sets for fair comparison
- Sprint 3: User wants to see the effort/impact of making compiler -> blocks one-way only
