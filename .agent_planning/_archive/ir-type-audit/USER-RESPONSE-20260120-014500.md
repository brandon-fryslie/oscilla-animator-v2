# User Response: Plan Approval

**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Status:** APPROVED (with revision)

## Approved Sprints

### Sprint 1: doc-alignment (HIGH)
- **Approved:** Yes
- **Revision:** Removed separate IR-SPEC-MAPPING.md - just add notes to existing spec

### Sprint 2: missing-features (MEDIUM)
- **Approved:** Yes
- **Notes:** Research gaps, create beads for needed functionality

## User Decisions

1. **Naming convention**: Keep both snake_case (spec) and camelCase (code) - add 1-sentence spec note that naming is not prescribed
2. **Slot types**: Keep unified ValueSlot - add 2-3 sentence spec note
3. **Gaps**: Create beads for missing functionality, spec is for concepts not implementation details
