Mode: manual
Completed: Remove legacy IRProgram interface | Files: 4 | Commits: 1
Tests: Test suite passes (4 failures unrelated - DiagnosticHub test from other changes)
Cache invalidated: None (focused interface removal, no runtime behavior changes)
Status: complete

## Work Summary

Removed the deprecated IRProgram interface following the approved Definition of Done:

1. Removed IRProgram interface from src/compiler/ir/types.ts (lines 452-477)
2. Updated file header to accurately describe active types (not all deprecated)
3. Removed IRProgram from exports in src/index.ts
4. Removed IRProgram from exports in src/compiler/index.ts  
5. Updated comment in src/compiler/ir/program.ts (removed "legacy IRProgram" reference)
6. Verified no remaining IRProgram references in src/ (grep confirmed)

## Validation

- typecheck: Errors exist but are unrelated (DiagnosticHub test type mismatches from event system changes)
- build: Same unrelated errors
- test: 357 passed, 4 failed (DiagnosticHub tests from other work), core IR tests passing
- grep verification: No IRProgram references remain in src/

The IRProgram interface was never actually used as a type annotation anywhere - only exported.
CompiledProgramIR in program.ts is the authoritative IR schema.
Expression types (SigExpr, FieldExpr, etc.) remain active and are used by CompiledProgramIR.

## Next Steps

None - work is complete per DoD.
