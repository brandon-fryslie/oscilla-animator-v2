Completed: ContinuityConfig, ContinuityControls, Runtime integration | Files: 6 | Commits: 6
Tests: 372 passing, 34 skipped
Cache invalidated: None required (isolated changes)
Status: complete

Implementation Summary:
1. Added ContinuityConfig to RuntimeState (decayExponent, tauMultiplier)
2. Extended ContinuityStore with config actions and computed getters
3. Created ContinuityControls component with sliders and buttons
4. Integrated controls into ContinuityPanel as collapsible section
5. Updated decayGauge() to read exponent from config
6. Applied tau multiplier to all policy tau values in applyContinuity()
7. Wired RuntimeState reference to ContinuityStore in main.ts

All acceptance criteria met:
- Decay exponent slider (0.1-2.0) controls gauge decay curve
- Tau multiplier slider (0.5-3.0) scales all transition times
- Reset to Defaults button restores exponent=0.7, multiplier=1.0
- Clear Continuity State button clears all buffers (with confirmation)
- Controls survive hot-swap (config persisted in RuntimeState)
- No TypeScript errors, no runtime errors
- Build passes, tests pass
