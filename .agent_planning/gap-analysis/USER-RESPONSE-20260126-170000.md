# User Response: Gap Analysis Update

## Decision: APPROVED

Sprint utility-blocks (U-8) completed successfully. All plans auto-approved per non-interactive session directive.

## Approved Files
- SPRINT-20260126-101500-utility-blocks-PLAN.md (marked COMPLETE)
- SPRINT-20260126-101500-utility-blocks-DOD.md (marked COMPLETE)
- EVALUATION-20260126-170000.md (post-implementation evaluation)
- SUMMARY.md (updated with U-8 completion)

## Implementation Notes
- Length/Normalize use component-based inputs (x, y, optional z) rather than packed vec2/vec3
- This is an acceptable MVP approach; vec2/vec3 automatic decomposition is future work
- All 1311 tests pass, typecheck clean

## Next Actions
- P3 user decisions (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8) require human input
- U-21 (layer system) is next major implementable work
- Layout kernels (U-30, U-31) are straightforward additions
