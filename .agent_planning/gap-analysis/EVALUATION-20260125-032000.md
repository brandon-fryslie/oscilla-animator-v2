# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Status Confirmation
Timestamp: 2026-01-25-032000
Git Commit: fbeed29 (branch: ralphie)

## Executive Summary
Overall: STABLE — no actionable critical work | Tests: 1259 pass (80 files) | Critical remaining: 3 (all BLOCKED)

## Verdict
- [x] NO ACTION NEEDED — gap analysis is stable, no implementable critical items remain.

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Vitest full suite | PASS | 1259 tests, 80 files, all pass (9.95s) |

## Remaining Critical Items (unchanged from prior evaluation)
1. **C-8** (EventPayload): BLOCKED — needs architectural design for event model
2. **C-9** (RenderPassIR): BLOCKED — tracked as ms5 epic in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5)
3. **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): BLOCKED — needs layer system (U-21) design

## Blocker Status
| Item | Blocker | Actionable? | Next Step |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| C-8 | Event model design needed | No | Requires architectural decision on EventPayload type |
| C-9 | ms5 epic migration | Partially | Sub-tasks exist in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5.*) |
| C-12 | Layer system (U-21) | No | Requires layer system architecture design |

## Recommendation
Focus on ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads which progressively unblock C-9. C-8 and C-12 require design work outside the gap-analysis scope.
