Timestamp: 2026-01-29-220000
Status: AUTO-APPROVED (non-interactive session)

## Decision
APPROVED — No action needed. Gap-analysis is CLOSED with all critical items resolved.

## Context
- All P1 critical items (12): DONE
- All P2 critical items (7/8): 7 DONE, 1 DEFERRED (C-12, blocked by U-21)
- All 3 sprints: CLOSED
- Tests: 1311/1311 pass (3 skipped)
- Typecheck: clean

## Next Steps
- C-12 unblocks when U-21 (layer system) is designed — separate planning topic
- P3 user decisions (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8) — separate topic
- P4-P5 unimplemented features — each a separate topic
