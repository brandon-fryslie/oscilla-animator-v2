## Work Completed This Session

### C-9/ms5.8: v1→v2 Render Pipeline Switchover — DONE

Full migration from v1 (RenderPassIR/assembleRenderPass) to v2 (DrawOp/assembleRenderFrame):

1. Added 3D projection to v2 assembler (commit 523a1d1)
2. Added SVG primitive rendering support (commit df39229)
3. Wired v2 into ScheduleExecutor (commit 9dcf3cc)
4. Migrated steel-thread tests (commit 9e4a4c4)
5. Migrated projection tests level5-10 (commit d6b3510)
6. Removed all v1 code (commit e688b80)
7. Renamed types to canonical names (commit 270d947)

Test suite: 1277/1277 pass (25 v1-only tests removed)

## Sprint Status

- C-9: DONE ✅
- C-8: BLOCKED (needs event model architecture)
- C-12: BLOCKED (needs layer system U-21)

## No Further Action

No actionable critical items remain. C-8 and C-12 are blocked by design decisions not yet made. The gap-analysis sprint is effectively complete for all implementable work.

## Planning Updated

- SUMMARY.md: Updated to reflect C-9 completion
- SPRINT-*-PLAN.md: C-9 marked DONE with commits
- SPRINT-*-DOD.md: C-9 criteria all checked
- EVALUATION-20260124-161600.md: Fresh evaluation written
