# User Response: Gap Analysis Plan
Timestamp: 2026-01-25T14:25:00Z

## Decision: AUTO-APPROVED (no actionable work)

## Context
The gap-analysis for CRITICAL items was evaluated. All 3 remaining items (C-8, C-9, C-12) are genuinely BLOCKED by external dependencies. No implementation work is possible.

## Sprint Status
- `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-PLAN.md`: BLOCKED (unchanged, accurate)
- `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-DOD.md`: BLOCKED (unchanged, accurate)

## Evaluation Summary
- Latest evaluation: EVALUATION-20260125-142500.md
- Verdict: NO ACTION NEEDED
- Tests: 1259/1259 pass
- Critical remaining: 3 (all BLOCKED)

## Next Steps
Progress on critical items requires:
1. C-8: EventPayload architectural design decision
2. C-9: ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5.*)
3. C-12: Layer system (U-21) design

## Deferred Work
None — all work is already tracked in the blocked sprint plan and beads.
