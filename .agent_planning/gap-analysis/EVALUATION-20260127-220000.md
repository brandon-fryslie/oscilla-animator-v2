# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Final Closure Confirmation
Timestamp: 2026-01-27-220000
Git Commit: 108d2e9

## Executive Summary
Overall: 100% complete (gap-analysis scope) | Critical issues: 0 actionable | Tests reliable: yes

Gap-analysis is COMPLETE. No actionable work remains. This evaluation confirms the prior evaluation (20260127-180000) and serves as the final closure record.

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| npm run test | PASS | 1311 passed, 3 skipped, 86 test files |
| npm run typecheck | PASS | Clean (zero errors) |
| Latest commit | 108d2e9 | feat(blocks): implement U-8 utility blocks |

## Sprint Completion Status

| Sprint | Status | Deliverables |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| p2-blocked (C-8, C-9 migration) | COMPLETE | EventPayload infra, v1->v2 render path |
| stateful-primitives (U-4, U-5) | COMPLETE | Lag, Phasor blocks |
| utility-blocks (U-8) | COMPLETE | Noise, Length, Normalize blocks |

## Findings

### All Planned Work Complete

- **P1 (12 items)**: All resolved.
- **P2 (8 items)**: 7 resolved, 1 correctly deferred (C-12, blocked by U-21).
- **P3 (4 items)**: User decisions — not actionable without human input.
- **P4-P5 (27 items)**: Forward feature work — separate planning scope.
- **Trivial (16 items)**: Cosmetic, no action needed.

### Remaining Item: C-12 (PathStyle blend/layer)
- Status: DEFERRED
- Blocked by: U-21 (layer system design)
- Rationale: Adding blend/layer fields to PathStyle without a consuming layer system would be dead code. Correctly deferred.

## Ambiguities Found
None. All prior ambiguities resolved.

## Recommendations
1. Close gap-analysis as an active topic — no further evaluations needed
2. Transition C-12 to U-21 layer system sprint (separate topic)
3. P3 decisions (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8) should be surfaced to user when relevant

## Verdict
- [x] COMPLETE - Gap-analysis scope is fully resolved. Topic closed.
- [ ] CONTINUE - N/A
- [ ] PAUSE - N/A
