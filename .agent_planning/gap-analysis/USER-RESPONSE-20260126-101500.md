# User Response: Gap Analysis Planning Update
Timestamp: 2026-01-26T10:15:00Z
Status: APPROVED (auto-approved per user directive)

## Context
All CRITICAL items are resolved. The only remaining critical item (C-12 PathStyle blend/layer) is blocked by U-21 (layer system design) with no functional impact.

## Approved Plans
1. SPRINT-20260126-101500-utility-blocks-PLAN.md — U-8 Noise, Length, Normalize blocks
2. SPRINT-20260126-101500-utility-blocks-DOD.md — Definition of Done

## Notes
- Noise block (HIGH confidence) can be implemented immediately
- Length/Normalize blocks (MEDIUM confidence) need investigation into vector component access patterns before implementation
- The isStateful consistency fix was applied (commit 459b468) as a trivial follow-up from the prior evaluation
