# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Sprint P2-Blocked COMPLETE

## Current State

All actionable critical gap-analysis items are resolved. The P2-Blocked sprint is effectively complete.

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck`: PASS (clean)
- `npm run test`: PASS (1284 tests, 3 skipped)

### Critical Items Final Status

| Item | Status | Resolution |
|------|--------|------------|
| P1 (12 items) | ALL DONE | C-1, C-3, C-7, C-14-C-23 |
| C-2 (vec3) | DONE | vec3 complete, shape→shape2d WON'T FIX |
| C-8 (EventPayload) | DONE | Infrastructure complete, U-6 unblocked |
| C-9 (Render v1→v2) | DONE | v1 removed, v2 canonical |
| C-10 (Phase clamp) | N/A | spec updated |
| C-11 (PathVerb) | N/A | code is canonical |
| C-12 (PathStyle blend/layer) | BLOCKED | Needs U-21 layer system design |
| C-13 (rotation/scale2) | DONE | Wired through IR |
| C-16 (slot lookup) | DONE | Pre-computed O(1) |

### Sprint P2-Blocked Summary

- **C-8**: DONE (commits 1e75e00, 46f26b9)
- **C-9**: DONE (commits 523a1d1..270d947)
- **C-12**: BLOCKED by U-21 (layer system design) — cannot be actioned

**Sprint Result**: 2/3 items complete, 1/3 externally blocked. Sprint is effectively COMPLETE.

## Verdict: COMPLETE

No actionable critical work remains. The gap-analysis critical priority work is done.

### Remaining Blocked Item (C-12)

C-12 (PathStyle blend/layer) requires:
1. Layer system architecture design (U-21)
2. BlendMode enum definition
3. LayerId type definition

This is a design decision requiring user input, not an implementation task. It blocks nothing directly and has no functional impact until the layer system exists.

## Recommendations

1. **Close sprint P2-Blocked** as complete
2. **Next priorities** (in order):
   - P3: User decisions (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8)
   - U-6: SampleAndHold block (now unblocked by C-8)
   - U-21: Layer system design (unblocks C-12)
3. **No further gap-analysis sprints needed** until new spec changes or U-21 design work begins
