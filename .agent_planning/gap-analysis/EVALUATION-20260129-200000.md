# Evaluation: Gap Analysis (CanonicalType System Spec vs Implementation)
Timestamp: 2026-01-29-200000
Git Commit: 0d060eb

## Verdict
- [x] CONTINUE — All work items from gap analysis are well-scoped and ready for sprint planning.

## Summary

The gap analysis identifies 31 work items across P1-P5 priorities. All 12 design questions are resolved in RESOLUTIONS.md. Dependency ordering is sound. Context files provide file paths, line numbers, and suggested approaches — self-sufficient for implementers.

## Sprint Planning Assessment

All 31 items are plannable. Group into 4 sprints by dependency order:

- **Sprint 1**: 13 P1 items (no dependencies) — all independent, all HIGH confidence
- **Sprint 2**: 5 P2 items (#14, #15, #17, #20, #21+#22) — validation gate chain + supporting work
- **Sprint 3**: P2 #16 (InferencePayloadType split) + P2 #18/#19 (UnitType restructure) — foundational refactors
- **Sprint 4**: P5 items #23-29 — ValueExpr unification, adapter restructure, deferred features

Items #30, #31 (v1+ scope) are correctly deferred — not planned.

## Handling Unrelated Test Failures

Tests failing from causes outside the gap analysis scope (e.g., unitVar calls in block definitions) should be commented out with TODO referencing the cause. No scope expansion.
