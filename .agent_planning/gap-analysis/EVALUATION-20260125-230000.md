# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Critical Items

Generated: 2026-01-25T23:00:00Z
Topic: gap-analysis
Verdict: COMPLETE (no actionable critical work remaining)

## Current State

### Sprint P2-Blocked: COMPLETE
- **C-8** (EventPayload): DONE (commits 1e75e00, 46f26b9)
- **C-9** (RenderPassIR migration): DONE (commits 523a1d1..270d947)
- **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): DEFERRED — blocked by U-21 (layer system design), no functional impact

### Test Suite
- 1284/1284 pass (3 skipped)
- Typecheck clean

### All P1 Critical Items: DONE
- C-7, C-14, C-15, C-17, C-18, C-20, C-21, C-22, C-23, C-1, C-3, C-19 — all resolved

### All P2 Critical Items: DONE or DEFERRED
- C-2 (vec3): DONE
- C-8 (EventPayload): DONE
- C-9 (RenderPassIR): DONE
- C-10, C-11: Resolved (no code change needed)
- C-12: DEFERRED (blocked by U-21)
- C-13 (rotation/scale2): DONE
- C-16 (slot lookup): DONE

## Assessment

**No actionable critical work remains.** The only unresolved critical item (C-12) is blocked by a design dependency (U-21 layer system) that must be resolved before implementation can proceed.

## Recommendations

### Next Priority Work (P3+):
1. **U-6 (SampleAndHold)**: Now unblocked by C-8 EventPayload infrastructure
2. **P3 User Decisions**: R-2 (Unit types), R-6 (Float precision), R-7 (Caching), R-8 (Expression IR)
3. **U-21 (Layer system design)**: When prioritized, will unblock C-12

### Sprint Status
- No new sprint needed for critical gap-analysis work
- Existing sprint correctly marked COMPLETE
- Planning docs accurate and up-to-date
