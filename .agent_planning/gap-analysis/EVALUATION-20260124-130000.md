# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — P2 Critical Items

## Current State

All P1 critical items resolved (12 items). P2 items C-13 and C-16 also fixed in this session.

**Remaining P2 critical items** (6 of original 8):
- C-2: vec3/shape2d PayloadType additions — blocked by 3D DoD work (in progress on branch)
- C-8: EventPayload design — needs architectural decision
- C-9: RenderPassIR migration — tracked as ms5 epic in beads
- C-10: Phase clamp semantics — R-5 resolved (phase01 stays), so this is now actionable
- C-11: PathVerb spec reconciliation — recommend spec update (code is internally consistent)
- C-12: PathStyle blend/layer — blocked by U-21 layer system design

## Assessment

### Actionable NOW (no external blockers)
- **C-10**: circleLayout phase clamp — R-5 is resolved (phase01 stays), so current code is correct. Mark as resolved.
- **C-11**: PathVerb constants — Code is internally consistent (CUBIC=2, QUAD=3). Spec should be updated to match code. This is a documentation fix.

### Blocked by Other Work (correct ordering)
- **C-2**: Already in progress via 3D DoD levels (vec3 work on this branch)
- **C-9**: Tracked as ms5 epic — large structural migration
- **C-12**: Requires layer system (U-21) design first
- **C-8**: Requires EventPayload architectural design

## Verdict: CONTINUE

C-10 and C-11 can be resolved immediately (spec updates / mark as resolved).
Remaining items are correctly sequenced behind their dependencies.
