# Topic 03: Axes -- Trivial Gaps

These are cosmetic divergences. No action needed unless doing a cleanup pass.

- **Spec: `validateAxes`** vs **Code: `validateTypes`**: `src/compiler/frontend/axis-validate.ts:36` -- spec refers to function as `validateAxes()`, code names it `validateTypes()`. Same concept, different name.
