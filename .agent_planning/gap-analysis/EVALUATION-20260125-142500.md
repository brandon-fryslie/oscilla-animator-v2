# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Critical Items Status Check
Timestamp: 2026-01-25-142500
Git Commit: 9ec278a (branch: ralphie)

## Executive Summary
Overall: STABLE — no actionable critical work | Tests: 1259 pass (80 files) | Critical remaining: 3 (all BLOCKED)

## Verdict
- [x] NO ACTION NEEDED — all remaining critical items are genuinely blocked by external dependencies.

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Vitest full suite | PASS | 1259 tests, 80 files, all pass (10.33s) |

## Remaining Critical Items (unchanged)
1. **C-8** (EventPayload): BLOCKED — needs architectural design for runtime event model
2. **C-9** (RenderPassIR): BLOCKED — tracked as ms5 epic in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5)
3. **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): BLOCKED — needs layer system (U-21) design

## Blocker Status
| Item | Blocker | Actionable? | Next Step |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| C-8 | Event model design needed | No | Requires architectural decision on EventPayload type |
| C-9 | ms5 epic migration | Partially | Sub-tasks exist in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5.*) |
| C-12 | Layer system (U-21) | No | Requires layer system architecture design |

## Changes Since Prior Evaluation (20260125-072200)
| Item | Was | Now | Reason |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| 3d L2 DoD | C4 upgrade | C4 scored | Commit 9ec278a |
| Critical items | 3 BLOCKED | 3 BLOCKED | No change |

## Recommendation
No actionable gap-analysis critical work remains. All 3 remaining items (C-8, C-9, C-12) are genuinely blocked by architectural design decisions or multi-task epics tracked separately.

**Unblocking paths:**
- C-9 is partially actionable via ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads (ready work items exist)
- C-8 requires fresh event model architecture design
- C-12 is lowest priority (cosmetic until layer system exists)

**Next priorities (outside gap-analysis scope):**
- ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads (progressively unblocks C-9)
- Expression DSL (oscilla-animator-v2-3zd)
- 3D world model (U-26, U-27 — now unblocked by C-2 completion)
