# User Response: Gap Analysis Plan
Timestamp: 2026-01-25T19:24:00Z

## Decision: AUTO-APPROVED (no actionable work, all BLOCKED)

## Context
The gap-analysis for CRITICAL items was evaluated. All 3 remaining items (C-8, C-9, C-12) are genuinely BLOCKED by external dependencies. No implementation work is possible within the gap-analysis critical scope.

## Sprint Status
- `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-PLAN.md`: BLOCKED (unchanged, accurate)
- `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-DOD.md`: BLOCKED (unchanged, accurate)

## Evaluation Summary
- Latest evaluation: EVALUATION-20260125-192400.md
- Verdict: BLOCKED
- Tests: 1259/1259 pass (497 suites)
- Critical remaining: 3 (all BLOCKED)

## Unblocking Path Summary
1. **C-9 (RenderPassIR)**: Most actionable — ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads are ready (ms5.4, ms5.5, ms5.7)
2. **C-8 (EventPayload)**: Needs architectural design decision
3. **C-12 (PathStyle blend/layer)**: Blocked by layer system (U-21), lowest priority

## Deferred Work
None — all work is already tracked in the blocked sprint plan and beads.
