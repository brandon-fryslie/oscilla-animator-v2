# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Status Confirmation
Timestamp: 2026-01-27-060000
Git Commit: 108d2e9

## Executive Summary
Overall: 100% complete (critical scope) | Critical issues: 0 actionable | No new sprint warranted

This evaluation confirms the gap-analysis effort remains complete. All P1 and P2 critical spec-implementation gaps are resolved. The single remaining P2 item (C-12, PathStyle blend/layer) remains correctly deferred — blocked by U-21 (layer system design), a P5 feature requiring design exploration.

## Current State
| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| P1 Critical (no deps) | 12/12 | ALL RESOLVED |
| P2 Critical (has deps) | 7/8 resolved, 1 deferred | COMPLETE (C-12 blocked by U-21) |
| Stateful Primitives Sprint | 4/4 | COMPLETE |
| Utility Blocks Sprint (U-8) | 3/3 | COMPLETE |
| Test Suite | 1311 pass, 3 skip | HEALTHY |
| Typecheck | Clean | HEALTHY |

## Why No New Sprint is Needed

The SUMMARY correctly states: `critical: 0 actionable (1 deferred/blocked)`. The only remaining critical item (C-12) cannot be resolved without first designing the layer system (U-21). U-21 is a feature-level design task, not a gap-correction task. Implementing C-12 without U-21 would produce dead code with no consumers.

## Remaining Work (Outside Gap-Analysis Scope)

### P3: User Architectural Decisions
- R-2: Unit type system (keep or revert?)
- R-6: Float64 vs Float32 for scalars
- R-7: Stamp-based vs CacheKey caching
- R-8: Expression trees vs op-level IR

### P4-P5: Feature Implementation (27 items)
These are unimplemented spec features, not spec-implementation divergences. They belong to feature planning sprints, not gap-analysis correction sprints.

## Verdict
The gap-analysis effort is COMPLETE. No further gap-analysis sprints are warranted. Transition to feature implementation planning via roadmap priorities.

- [x] CONTINUE - No actionable critical items remain
- [ ] PAUSE - N/A
- [ ] BLOCKED - N/A
