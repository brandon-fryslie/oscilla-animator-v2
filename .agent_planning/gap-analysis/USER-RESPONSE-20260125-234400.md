# User Response: EVALUATION-20260125-234400

## Decision: AUTO-APPROVED

All plans are auto-approved per session instructions (user specified all plans auto-approved).

## Responses to Evaluation Recommendations

### 1. Close U-6 as DONE
**Decision**: ACCEPTED
**Rationale**: SampleHold exists at `src/blocks/event-blocks.ts:53-113` and works for boolean triggers. EventPayload consumption is a separate future enhancement if needed.

### 2. Next sprint: U-4 + U-5 (Lag + Phasor)
**Decision**: ACCEPTED
**Rationale**: Completes the 4 MVP stateful primitives per spec (RESOLUTION-LOG D1). Both follow established patterns. HIGH confidence.
**Output**: `SPRINT-20260126-000000-stateful-primitives-PLAN.md`

### 3. Consider U-8 in same sprint
**Decision**: DEFERRED to subsequent sprint
**Rationale**: Keep this sprint focused on stateful primitives only. U-8 (Noise, Length, Normalize) are pure utility blocks and can be their own sprint.

### 4. Resolve P3 as spec-updates
**Decision**: DEFERRED
**Rationale**: No functional impact. Can be resolved as a documentation pass after MVP stateful primitives are complete.

## Sprint Created
- `SPRINT-20260126-000000-stateful-primitives-PLAN.md` [HIGH confidence, READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION]
- `SPRINT-20260126-000000-stateful-primitives-DOD.md`
- `SPRINT-20260126-000000-stateful-primitives-CONTEXT.md`

## Assessment

The gap-analysis critical sprint (P2-Blocked) is COMPLETE:
- C-8 (EventPayload): DONE
- C-9 (v1-v2 render): DONE
- C-12 (PathStyle blend/layer): DEFERRED (blocked by U-21)
- U-6 (SampleAndHold): DONE (already implemented as SampleHold)

Next sprint targets U-4 (Lag) + U-5 (Phasor) to complete all 4 MVP stateful primitives.

## Next Priorities (from evaluation)
1. U-4 (Lag) + U-5 (Phasor) -- SPRINT CREATED, READY FOR /do:it
2. U-8 (Noise, Length, Normalize) -- pure utility blocks, no state
3. P3 user decisions (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8) -- spec alignment
4. U-21 (layer system design) -- would unblock C-12
