# User Response: Gap Analysis Complete

## Status: COMPLETE (No Further Sprints Needed)

All critical (P1, P2) gap-analysis items have been resolved. The gap-analysis effort has achieved its primary goal: all spec-implementation divergences at the critical level are fixed.

## Summary

- **P1 items**: 12/12 resolved
- **P2 items**: 7/8 resolved, 1 deferred (C-12, blocked by U-21 layer system design)
- **Test suite**: 1311/1311 pass (3 skipped)
- **Typecheck**: Clean

## Remaining Items (Not Gap-Analysis)

These items are feature work, not correction work:
- **P3 (User Decisions)**: R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8 — require human architectural choices
- **P4-P5 (Unimplemented)**: 27 items — forward feature work, not spec divergences
- **C-12**: Deferred, blocked by U-21 (layer system design)

## Next Actions

1. Close gap-analysis as an active effort
2. Solicit P3 user decisions when ready
3. Plan U-30/U-31 layout kernels as feature sprints
4. Eventually design U-21 layer system (unblocks C-12)
