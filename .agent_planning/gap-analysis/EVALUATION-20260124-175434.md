Timestamp: 2026-01-24T17:54:34Z
Git Commit: 108d2e9

## Executive Summary
Overall: CLOSED | Critical issues: 0 actionable | Tests: 1311 pass, 3 skipped | Typecheck: clean

Gap-analysis scope is fully resolved. All P1 and P2 critical items have been implemented and verified. No new critical items have emerged.

## Sprint Status (All Complete)
| Sprint | Status |
|--------|--------|
| p2-blocked (C-8, C-9) | COMPLETE |
| stateful-primitives (U-4, U-5) | COMPLETE |
| utility-blocks (U-8) | COMPLETE |

## Remaining Items (Out of Scope)
- **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): DEFERRED — blocked by U-21 (layer system). Separate topic.
- **P3** (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8): User decisions required. Separate planning scope.
- **P4-P5** (27 items): Future features. Separate topics.
- **Trivial** (16 items): Cosmetic. No action needed.

## Verdict
- [x] COMPLETE - Gap-analysis scope fully resolved. No new sprints needed.
- [ ] CONTINUE - N/A
- [ ] PAUSE - N/A
- [ ] BLOCKED - N/A

## Planning Recommendation
No new sprint plans needed for gap-analysis. Forward work should be planned under dedicated topics:
- C-12 → `layer-system` topic (when U-21 is prioritized)
- P3 → Individual user-decision topics
- P4-P5 → Individual feature topics
