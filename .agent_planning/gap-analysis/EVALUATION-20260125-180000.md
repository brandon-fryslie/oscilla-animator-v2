# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Critical Items Status Check
Timestamp: 2026-01-25-180000
Git Commit: 9ec278a (branch: ralphie)

## Executive Summary
Overall: STABLE — no actionable critical work | Tests: 1259 pass (497 suites) | Critical remaining: 3 (all BLOCKED)

## Verdict
- [x] NO ACTION NEEDED — all remaining critical items are genuinely blocked by external dependencies.

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Vitest full suite | PASS | 1259 tests, 497 suites, all pass |

## Remaining Critical Items (unchanged from prior evaluation)
1. **C-8** (EventPayload): BLOCKED — needs architectural design for runtime event model
2. **C-9** (RenderPassIR): BLOCKED — tracked as ms5 epic in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5)
3. **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): BLOCKED — needs layer system (U-21) design

## Blocker Status
| Item | Blocker | Actionable? | Next Step |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| C-8 | Event model design needed | No | Requires architectural decision on EventPayload type |
| C-9 | ms5 epic migration | Partially | Sub-tasks exist in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5.*) |
| C-12 | Layer system (U-21) | No | Requires layer system architecture design |

## Changes Since Prior Evaluation (20260125-142500)
| Item | Was | Now | Reason |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| Critical items | 3 BLOCKED | 3 BLOCKED | No change |
| Test suite | 1259 pass | 1259 pass | No change |

## Sprint Plan Status
- `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-PLAN.md`: BLOCKED (accurate, no update needed)
- `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-DOD.md`: BLOCKED (accurate, no update needed)

## Recommendation
No actionable gap-analysis critical work remains. The existing sprint plan accurately reflects blocked state.

**Unblocking paths (unchanged):**
- C-9 is partially actionable via ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads (ready work items exist)
- C-8 requires fresh event model architecture design
- C-12 is lowest priority (cosmetic until layer system exists)

**Next priorities (outside gap-analysis critical scope):**
- ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads (progressively unblocks C-9)
- 3D world model levels (continuing L3+)
- Expression DSL (oscilla-animator-v2-3zd)
