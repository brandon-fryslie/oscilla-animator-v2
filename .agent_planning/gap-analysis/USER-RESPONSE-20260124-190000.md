# User Response: Gap Analysis P2-Blocked Sprint

Date: 2026-01-24T19:00:00Z
Status: AUTO-APPROVED (non-interactive session)

## Decision

All plans auto-approved per user directive (fully non-interactive session).

## Context

- C-2 (vec3) is DONE — all layout kernels produce vec3, tests pass
- C-2 (shape→shape2d) is WON'T FIX — pure churn, no functional value
- Remaining P2 items (C-8, C-9, C-12) are correctly blocked by dependencies
- No actionable critical work remains in gap-analysis

## Files Approved

- SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-PLAN.md
- SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-DOD.md

## Outcome

Gap analysis is in a stable state. All actionable critical items resolved.
Next work should focus on ms5 epic sub-tasks (beads) which unblock C-9.
