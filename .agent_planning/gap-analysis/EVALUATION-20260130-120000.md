# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — CLOSED (No Actionable Work)
Timestamp: 2026-01-30-120000
Git Commit: 108d2e9

## Executive Summary
Overall: COMPLETE | Critical issues: 0 actionable | Tests: 1311/1311 pass (3 skipped) | Typecheck: clean

Gap-analysis topic remains CLOSED. All P1 and P2 critical items resolved across 3 completed sprints. The single deferred item (C-12 PathStyle blend/layer) remains blocked by U-21 (layer system design) — no functional impact and cannot be actioned without U-21 work.

## Status Check
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| P1 Critical Items (12) | ALL DONE |
| P2 Critical Items (7/8) | 7 DONE, 1 DEFERRED (C-12) |
| C-12 Actionable? | NO — blocked by U-21 |
| Sprint: p2-blocked | CLOSED |
| Sprint: stateful-primitives | CLOSED |
| Sprint: utility-blocks | CLOSED |
| Tests | 1311/1311 pass |
| Typecheck | Clean |

## Verdict
- [x] COMPLETE - No actionable work remains in gap-analysis scope.
- [ ] CONTINUE - N/A
- [ ] PAUSE - N/A

## No New Sprints Needed

All critical work is resolved. The remaining C-12 item is blocked by U-21 (layer system design), which is a separate planning topic. No new sprints can be generated for gap-analysis.

## Remaining Out-of-Scope Items (tracked elsewhere)
- **C-12**: PathStyle blend/layer — blocked by U-21 (layer system). Separate planning topic.
- **P3** (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8): User decisions. Separate topic.
- **P4-P5** (27 items): Unimplemented features. Each a separate planning topic.
- **Trivial** (16 items): Cosmetic. No action.

## Conclusion
No new sprints needed. Gap-analysis scope is fully resolved. Future work (C-12, P3-P5) belongs to separate planning topics (layer-system, user-decisions, etc.).
