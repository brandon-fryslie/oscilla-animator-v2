# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Critical Items Status Check
Timestamp: 2026-01-25T21:00:00Z
Git Commit: d6d1e58 (branch: ralphie)

## Executive Summary
Overall: STABLE — no actionable critical work | Tests: 1259 pass (497 suites) | Critical remaining: 3 (all BLOCKED)

## Verdict: BLOCKED
All 3 remaining critical items have external dependencies that prevent implementation.
No work was performed — the blocked state is accurate and unchanged since prior evaluation.

## Remaining Critical Items (unchanged from 2026-01-25T19:24:00Z)
1. **C-8** (EventPayload): BLOCKED — needs architectural design for runtime event model
2. **C-9** (RenderPassIR): BLOCKED — tracked as ms5 epic in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5)
3. **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): BLOCKED — needs layer system (U-21) design

## Blocker Status
| Item | Blocker | Actionable? | Next Step |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| C-8 | Event model design needed | No | Requires architectural decision on EventPayload type |
| C-9 | ms5 epic migration | Partially | Sub-tasks exist in beads (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5.*) |
| C-12 | Layer system (U-21) | No | Requires layer system architecture design |

## Sprint Plan Status
- `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-PLAN.md`: BLOCKED (accurate, no update needed)
- `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked-DOD.md`: BLOCKED (accurate, no update needed)

## Unblocking Paths
- **C-9**: Partially actionable via ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads (ready work items: oscilla-animator-v2-ms5.4, ms5.5, ms5.7)
- **C-8**: Requires fresh event model architecture design (no spec for EventPayload exists yet)
- **C-12**: Lowest priority — cosmetic until layer system (U-21) exists

## Recommendation
No changes to existing sprint plan needed. The BLOCKED state is accurate and current.
Next actionable work for unblocking: work on ms5 epic sub-tasks (which are tracked separately in beads, not in gap-analysis).
