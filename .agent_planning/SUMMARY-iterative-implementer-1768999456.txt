Sprint 1: Add Missing Opcodes to OpcodeInterpreter - COMPLETE

All work items completed:

P0: ✓ Added 8 unary opcodes to applyUnaryOp
  - floor, ceil, round, fract, sqrt, exp, log, sign
  - All implemented with proper Math.* calls
  
P1: ✓ Added binary pow opcode to applyNaryOp
  - Uses expectArity for strict validation (exactly 2 arguments)
  - Properly throws error on arity mismatch
  
P2: ✓ Added expectArity helper function
  - Clean validation pattern for fixed-arity operations
  - Used by pow opcode, available for future opcodes
  
P3: ✓ Updated header comment with complete opcode reference
  - All opcodes organized by arity (UNARY, BINARY, TERNARY, VARIADIC)
  - Documents the SINGLE ENFORCER architecture
  - Clear reference for developers

Validation:
- Build: SUCCESS (pnpm build completed without errors)
- Tests: 510/513 passing (3 pre-existing failures in Hash Block tests)
  - Failures unrelated to opcode changes
  - Hash block returning raw values (123456, 42) instead of [0,1)
  - Pre-existing issue, not introduced by this sprint
