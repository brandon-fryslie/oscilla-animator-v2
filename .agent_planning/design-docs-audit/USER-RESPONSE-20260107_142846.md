## Approved Plan Summary

### Sprint Goal
Reconcile design doc contradictions, create accurate spec index, and build phased implementation roadmap

### Approved Deliverables

1. **Contradictions & Ambiguities Report**
   - File: `.agent_planning/design-docs-audit/CONTRADICTIONS-20260107_142846.md`
   - Catalog all contradictions between spec files
   - Document spec vs final-System-Invariants conflicts
   - Expand 4 ambiguities from AMBIGUITIES.md
   - Create implementation gap matrix

2. **INDEX.md Rewrite**
   - File: `design-docs/spec/INDEX.md`
   - Fix all file paths (currently all wrong - flat vs subdirectories)
   - Add 5 missing spec files
   - Add status indicators and descriptions
   - Clarify final-System-Invariants relationship

3. **Phased Implementation Roadmap**
   - File: `.agent_planning/design-docs-audit/ROADMAP-PHASED-20260107_142846.md`
   - Define 3 phases from current v2 to full spec
   - Map all spec files to phases
   - Identify dependencies and complexity estimates

4. **V1 Pattern Analysis**
   - File: `.agent_planning/design-docs-audit/V1-PATTERNS-20260107_142846.md`
   - Extract patterns to preserve (5+)
   - Extract anti-patterns to avoid (5+)
   - Map v1→v2 concepts (10+)

### Key Context

**Critical Issues Found:**
- 4 different sources with conflicting stateful blocks lists
- INDEX.md has wrong paths for ALL 9 core spec files
- 10+ critical ambiguities blocking implementation
- V2 implements ~40% of spec

**Estimated Duration**: 3-5 days (documentation sprint only)
