# User Response: Composite Block System Planning
Generated: 2026-01-27T15:04:00Z

## Status: PENDING APPROVAL

## Design Decisions Made

| Question | User Response |
|----------|---------------|
| Where should definitions live? | Unified Block Registry with `form='composite'` (macros are different) |
| How should expansion work? | Graph normalization pass (Recommended) |
| How should the editor work? | Separate tab in main center area (same space as node editor) |
| How should library composites be distributed? | Hybrid (code + JSON) |
| How should port exposure work? | Explicit port mapping |
| Should composites support internal state? | Yes, with stable state keys |
