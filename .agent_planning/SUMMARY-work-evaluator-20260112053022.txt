Scope: work/pass7-schedule
Verdict: COMPLETE
Criteria: 3/3 working (P0, P1, P2 all met) | Breaks found: 0 | Ambiguities: 0
Previous issues: N/A (first evaluation)
Missing checks: 0 specified
Cache updated: No updates needed (fresh implementation, no reusable patterns identified yet)

Details:
- All Definition of Done criteria met for Pass 7 Schedule Construction
- Implementation correctly generates render steps, wires inputs, and resolves domains
- 5 test failures identified as pre-existing bugs in other components (Pass 3, test code)
- main.ts compiles and runs successfully with correct field wiring
- Type safety maintained throughout implementation
- Code quality: clean, well-commented, follows spec

Test failures root causes (NOT Pass 7 bugs):
1. steel-thread.test.ts - incorrect signal-to-field wiring in test patch
2. compile.test.ts (TimeRoot) - test expects wrong error code
3. compile.test.ts (FiniteTimeRoot) - Pass 3 stub always returns infinite
4-5. runtime integration tests - cascade from steel-thread wiring bug

Next action: Pass 7 implementation is complete and correct. Test fixes needed in other components.
