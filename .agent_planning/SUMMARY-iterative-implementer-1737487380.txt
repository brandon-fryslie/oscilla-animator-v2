==================================================
RETE.JS REMOVAL - COMPLETE
==================================================

SCOPE:
Complete removal of Rete.js from codebase per PLAN-20260118.md

CONTEXT:
- Rete.js was previously disabled in UI
- React Flow is the active node editor
- Most Rete code already deleted in prior cleanup
- Only comment references remained

WORK COMPLETED:

1. Code Changes (2 files modified):
   ✓ src/ui/editorCommon/EditorContext.tsx - Updated header comment
   ✓ src/ui/editorCommon/index.ts - Updated header comment

2. Verification (All Passed):
   ✓ npm run typecheck - 0 errors
   ✓ npm run build - Success (3.16 MB bundle, 940 kB gzipped)
   ✓ npm test - 547 tests passing, 4 skipped
   ✓ npm ls rete - (empty) - No rete packages found

3. Cache Invalidation (3 files removed):
   ✓ runtime-dockview-integration.md - Mentioned Rete editor in layout
   ✓ runtime-sprint2a-validation.md - Mentioned rete-history-plugin  
   ✓ runtime-ui-blocklibrary.md - Stale (deleted in commit)
   ✓ Updated INDEX.md with invalidation entry

4. Documentation:
   ✓ Created COMPLETE-20260121.md with full verification results

COMMITS:
- c3bf622 - chore: remove final Rete.js references from comments
- 31c5a6c - docs: complete Rete.js removal sprint

ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT:

Before:
- Dual editor abstraction (Rete | ReactFlow)
- 8 rete npm packages
- ~850 lines of Rete integration code
- Complex type unions and conditional logic

After:
- Single editor: React Flow only
- EditorHandle type: 'reactflow' only
- Zero rete packages
- Simplified architecture

VERIFICATION SUMMARY:

TypeScript:     ✅ 0 errors
Build:          ✅ Success (20.36s)
Tests:          ✅ 547 passing, 4 skipped
Dependencies:   ✅ No rete packages
References:     ✅ No code references
Comments:       ✅ All updated
Cache:          ✅ Stale entries removed

==================================================
READY FOR PRODUCTION
==================================================

Next Steps:
- None required - Rete.js completely eliminated
- Future enhancements can be added to React Flow as needed:
  * Connection validation (implement validateConnection)
  * Undo/Redo (add to PatchStore)
  * MiniMap (enable <MiniMap /> component)
  * Auto-arrange (integrate elkjs)
  * Context menu (add right-click handler)
