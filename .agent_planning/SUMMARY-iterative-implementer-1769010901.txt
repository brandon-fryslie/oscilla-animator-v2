## Sprint Verification: log-panel-fix

### Status: ALREADY COMPLETE ✓

The LogPanel integration sprint was successfully completed on 2026-01-18 in commit 19b9a93.

### Implementation Summary

**Files Created:**
- src/ui/dockview/panels/LogPanel.tsx (13 lines)
  - Dockview panel wrapper following DiagnosticConsolePanel pattern
  - Implements IDockviewPanelProps interface
  - Wraps LogPanel component from ui/components/app/

**Files Modified:**
- src/ui/dockview/panelRegistry.ts (+3 lines)
  - Added LogPanel import
  - Added panel definition: { id: 'log-panel', component: 'log-panel', title: 'Logs', group: 'bottom-left' }
  - Added component mapping: 'log-panel': LogPanel

### Verification Results

**✓ TypeScript Typecheck:** PASS
- No compilation errors
- All types properly defined

**✓ Build:** PASS
- Clean production build (3.1MB bundle)
- Only expected warnings (MUI "use client" directives)

**✓ Tests:** PASS
- 547 tests passing
- 4 tests skipped
- All 36 test files pass

**✓ Implementation Pattern:** CORRECT
- Follows exact pattern of DiagnosticConsolePanel.tsx
- Proper imports and exports
- Correct interface implementation
- Added to bottom-left group as specified
- Placed after Console tab as planned

### Definition of Done Status

All technical requirements met:
- [x] Dockview panel wrapper created at `src/ui/dockview/panels/LogPanel.tsx`
- [x] LogPanel registered in `PANEL_DEFINITIONS` array
- [x] LogPanel added to `PANEL_COMPONENTS` object
- [x] LogPanel added to `'bottom-left'` group in default layout
- [x] Tab order: Console first, Logs second
- [x] Follows existing panel wrapper pattern (implements `IDockviewPanelProps`)
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] No new warnings in console
- [x] Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- [x] Proper imports and exports

### Manual Verification Recommended

The following acceptance criteria require browser verification (not blocking):
- [ ] LogPanel displays in the bottom area as a tab
- [ ] LogPanel is next to the Diagnostics panel (both tabs in same group)
- [ ] Users can switch between Console and Logs tabs
- [ ] LogPanel shows logs from `rootStore.diagnostics.logs`
- [ ] Logs display with proper color coding (error=red, warn=yellow, info=blue)
- [ ] Log panel auto-scrolls when new logs arrive
- [ ] Panel is resizable (height can be adjusted)

### Cache Maintenance

**No cache invalidation needed:**
- Implementation was already complete before this verification
- No files modified during this session
- Eval cache file `runtime-diagnostics-logging.md` covers DiagnosticConsole, not LogPanel
- No eval cache entries exist specific to LogPanel or panel registration patterns
