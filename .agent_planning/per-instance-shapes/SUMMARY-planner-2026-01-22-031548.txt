Work Items: 7 (P0: 2, P1: 2, P2: 2, P3: 1)

Blocking Dependency: oscilla-animator-v2-583 (RenderAssembler v2) MUST be complete first
Status: This sprint CANNOT start until dependency is closed

Key Deliverables:
  1. Shape buffer resolution ({ k: 'slot' } case)
  2. Topology grouping algorithm (O(N) single-pass)
  3. Multi-op emission (one DrawPathInstancesOp per topology group)
  4. Instance buffer slicing (position, color per group)
  5. Renderer integration (loop over all ops)
  6. Shape2D buffer format documentation
  7. Comprehensive error handling and validation

Confidence Level: MEDIUM
  - Shape2D buffer format defined in spec but not yet implemented in materializer
  - Performance targets estimated, need user confirmation
  - Algorithm clear but needs validation with realistic scenarios
  - EXIT CRITERIA: dependency closed, buffer format agreed, materializer capability confirmed

Next: Block on oscilla-animator-v2-583, then research Shape2D buffer format with user
