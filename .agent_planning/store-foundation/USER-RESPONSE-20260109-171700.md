# User Response: Store Foundation DoD

**Date**: 2026-01-09 17:17:00
**Status**: APPROVED with constraint

## Decision

User approved the Definition of Done with an important constraint:

> **Do NOT copy code from v1.** Use the patterns to write new stores for our project, but it's too risky to copy code over wholesale. We abandoned that project because it was poisoned with too many problems and we don't want to risk bringing them in.

## Implementation Guidance

- Write all store code fresh from scratch
- Use v1 as reference for patterns only (store composition, derived state, action boundaries)
- Do NOT copy-paste any v1 code
- Prioritize v2's cleaner type system (ImmutablePatch, branded IDs, etc.)
- Start simple and add complexity only as needed
