# User Response: cardinality-polymorphism Sprint

**Date:** 2026-01-25T16:05:00
**Status:** APPROVED

## Approved Sprint

SPRINT-2026-01-25-160000-port-types

## Approved Work Items

- [x] P0: Revert FromDomainId to fieldOnly
- [x] P1: Complete port types for PRESERVE blocks (7 blocks)
- [x] P2: Fix non-canonical lower() guards (9 blocks)
- [x] P3: Verify identity blocks stay fieldOnly
- [x] P4: Test and commit

## Notes

User requested spec review, which led to important corrections:
- FromDomainId must be reverted to fieldOnly (per spec §6.2)
- StableIdHash/DomainIndex confirmed to stay fieldOnly (use intrinsics)
- Plan aligns with `design-docs/Polymorphic-Cardinality-Spec.md`

## Next Steps

Implementation can proceed with `/do:it cardinality-polymorphism`
