Completed: docs/ folder structure, execution-model.md documentation, ScheduleExecutor.ts comments, CLAUDE.md integration | Files: 4 | Commits: 1

Cache invalidated: None (no existing cache entries covered modified files)
Status: complete

## Summary

Successfully created comprehensive execution model documentation for Oscilla Animator v2 runtime.

### Deliverables

1. **Docs Folder Structure** (P0 - Complete)
   - Created `docs/` directory at project root
   - Created `docs/runtime/` subdirectory for runtime documentation
   - Created `docs/README.md` with navigation, purpose, and conventions
   - Established kebab-case naming convention

2. **Execution Model Documentation** (P1 - Complete)
   - Created `docs/runtime/execution-model.md` (~9.5k tokens)
   - Comprehensive coverage of two-phase execution pattern
   - Explained WHY phasing is non-negotiable (not just how)
   - Documented invariant I7 enforcement (cycles must cross stateful boundary)
   - Included 3 detailed examples:
     - Example 1: Correct UnitDelay feedback loop with frame-by-frame execution
     - Example 2: Violation scenario showing what breaks without two-phase
     - Example 3: Schedule structure with step ordering
   - Documented all step types and phase assignment
   - Added maintenance guidelines for future contributors

3. **Code Integration** (P3 - Complete)
   - Updated `ScheduleExecutor.ts` with expanded comment block (lines 167-182)
   - Added clear rationale, invariant references, and link to docs
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new "Two-Phase Execution Model" section
   - Cross-referenced docs, implementation, and spec

### Validation

- TypeScript compilation: **PASSED** (npm run typecheck)
- No behavioral tests required (documentation-only sprint)
- Manual verification: All files created, comments added, links correct

### Commits

- `04d6c13` - docs: Add two-phase execution reference to CLAUDE.md
- (Previous commits for docs/ and ScheduleExecutor.ts already in history)

### Cache Invalidation

**No cache entries invalidated.** Rationale:
- No existing eval-cache files covered ScheduleExecutor.ts implementation patterns
- No cache files documented runtime execution flow
- Documentation additions don't invalidate runtime behavior knowledge
- Existing cache entries remain valid

### Ready for Evaluation

Yes. Documentation is complete, comprehensive, and linked to implementation.

### Next Steps

User can:
1. Review `docs/runtime/execution-model.md` for technical accuracy
2. Use as reference when modifying runtime or adding stateful blocks
3. Continue with additional runtime documentation (continuity, hot-swap, etc.)
