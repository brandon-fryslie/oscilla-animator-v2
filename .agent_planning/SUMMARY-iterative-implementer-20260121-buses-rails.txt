## Summary

The buses-and-rails sprint to simplify DefaultSource was **already completed** in previous work (commits c16d945 through 2835774). This session performed comprehensive verification.

## Verification Results

✅ All DoD criteria met:
- DefaultSource type unified to `{ blockType, output, params? }`
- Helper functions exist: defaultSourceConst(), defaultSourceTimeRoot()
- Old helpers removed (verified via grep)
- All block definitions updated to new API
- pass1-default-sources handles TimeRoot specially
- pass1 creates derived blocks for other defaults
- UI uses blockType checks (not kind)
- Tests: 547 passing
- TypeScript: compiles clean
- Build: succeeds
