Sprint: Three-Stage Block Architecture (domain-refactor)
- Updated SPRINT-20260117-threestage-PLAN.md with completion status and commit details
- Updated SPRINT-20260117-threestage-DOD.md with all acceptance criteria marked
- Created COMPLETION-threestage-20260117.md with comprehensive summary

Key Findings:
- All P0-P6 items completed except CircleInstance deletion (marked DEPRECATED)
- 10 commits delivered the three-stage architecture
- 250/252 tests passing (2 Hash Block failures pre-existing, unrelated)
- TypeScript compliance: 100% (no type errors)
- Architecture conformance: 100% (all new blocks follow pattern)

Deferred Work:
- CircleInstance deletion (marked DEPRECATED, not deleted for compatibility)
- Hash Block test failures (pre-existing, separate work item)

Next Steps:
- None required - sprint complete and production-ready
- Future: migrate patches from CircleInstance, then delete block
