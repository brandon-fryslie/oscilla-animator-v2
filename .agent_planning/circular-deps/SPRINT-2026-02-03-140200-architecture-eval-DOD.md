## Acceptance Criteria

### Option C Analysis (Shared IR Primitives)
- [ ] Types/values to extract identified with per-item import counts
- [ ] LowerSandbox extractability assessed (yes/no with rationale)
- [ ] Before/after dependency graph sketched
- [ ] File change count estimated
- [ ] Viability verdict: pursue or abandon

### Option A Analysis (Status Quo)
- [ ] Pros/cons documented
- [ ] User consulted on architecture preference
- [ ] Decision recorded in planning artifacts

### Option B Analysis (Compiler Owns Lowering)
- [ ] lower() function count and LOC quantified
- [ ] Extensibility impact assessed
- [ ] Verdict: pursue or abandon

## Exit Criteria (to raise confidence)
- [ ] User has provided input on architectural preference
- [ ] At least one option has a concrete, actionable migration plan
- [ ] Decision is made: which option (A, B, or C) to pursue, or "none -- status quo is acceptable"
