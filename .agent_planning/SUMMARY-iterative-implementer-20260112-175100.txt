## Summary

Verified P3 (Connection Matrix) and P4 (Split Sidebar) implementation status.

**Finding**: Both features are already fully implemented and working.

### P3: Connection Matrix - ✅ COMPLETE
- Matrix with row/column headers showing block names
- Connection indicators (●) with counts for multiple edges
- Click cells to select edges, click headers to select blocks
- Diagonal shows = for self-reference
- Bus blocks in separate "BUSES" section
- TimeRoot blocks filtered out
- Horizontal scroll via MUI DataGrid

**File**: `src/ui/components/ConnectionMatrix.tsx` (302 lines)

### P4: Split Sidebar - ✅ COMPLETE
- SplitPanel component at `src/ui/components/app/SplitPanel.tsx` (113 lines)
- Left sidebar uses SplitPanel with Library (top) and Inspector (bottom)
- Draggable divider with visual feedback
- Percentage-based minimum heights (10%/90%)
- Right sidebar unchanged (still uses Tabs)

**File**: `src/ui/components/app/SplitPanel.tsx` (113 lines)
**Integration**: `src/ui/components/app/App.tsx:118-133`

### Verification
- ✅ TypeScript: Clean compilation, no errors
- ✅ Tests: 274 passed, 8 skipped (all pre-existing)
- ✅ Integration: Both components integrated into App
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met

### Implementation Notes
1. Multi-edge selection selects first edge (acceptable given SelectionStore architecture)
2. SplitPanel uses percentage-based minimums (more responsive than pixel-based)

**No implementation work required - features already complete**
