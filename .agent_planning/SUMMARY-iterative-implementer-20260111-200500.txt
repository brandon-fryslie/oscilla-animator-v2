  - pass6-block-lowering now imports from blocks/registry
  - Removed duplicate blockType variable
  - Simplified lowerBlockInstance function

✓ P3: Deleted legacy registries
  - Removed entire src/compiler/blocks/ directory
  - Cleaned up lowerTypes.ts (removed BlockTypeDecl, registerBlockType, etc.)
  - Deleted src/ui/registry/blockTypes.ts
  - Updated src/index.ts to export from unified registry

IN PROGRESS:
- P5: Fixing build errors
