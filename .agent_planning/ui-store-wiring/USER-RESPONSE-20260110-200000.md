# User Response: UI Store Wiring

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-10 20:00
**Status**: APPROVED

## Approved Plan Files
- PLAN-20260110-200000.md
- DOD-20260110-200000.md

## User Decisions

1. **Scope Approval**: Approved - proceed with full React conversion scope
2. **Block Library Click Behavior**: Preview first
   - Click block type → show preview in Inspector
   - Double-click or "Add" button → add block to patch
   - This aligns with P8 feature from ui-features-v2 plan

## Notes
- This work is blocking all other UI work
- Selection state needs to be reconciled (rootStore.selection vs custom singleton)
- Estimated 10-14 hours of implementation
