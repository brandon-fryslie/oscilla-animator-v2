# Completion: UI Store Wiring - React Conversion

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-10 20:13
**Status**: PARTIAL COMPLETE

## What Was Delivered

**Architecture goal achieved**: Vanilla DOM components converted to React + MobX
- All components now use `observer()` pattern
- Single source of truth for selection (rootStore.selection)
- React roots mounted in main.ts
- TypeScript compiles, 202 tests pass

**Components converted**:
- DomainsPanel.tsx
- BlockLibrary.tsx (click = preview, double-click = add)
- BlockInspector.tsx
- TableView.tsx
- ConnectionMatrix.tsx (updated to observer)

## What's Missing (User Feedback)

The UI is "largely unusable in any practical sense":

1. **No split sidebar** - Can't see Library and Inspector simultaneously
2. **Inspector is extremely basic** - Just shows block ID and type name
3. **Matrix view unhelpful** - Shows b1, b2, etc. without identifying info
4. **No visual feedback** - Rows don't highlight on click
5. **No navigation** - Clicking junctions doesn't open inspector

## User Decision

> "We focus on all of the other stuff I said we need to do as well, and then we move UI over from the old project"

This means:
- UI refinement is **deferred**
- Focus shifts to other core work
- Eventually port UI from v1 codebase (`~/code/oscilla-animator_codex`)

## Deferred Work Items

### From TODO-ui-store-wiring.md (not done)
- [ ] Split sidebar layout (Library + Inspector visible together)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Delete key)
- [ ] Context menus
- [ ] Edge creation UI
- [ ] Auto-recompile on patch changes

### UI Polish (from user feedback)
- [ ] Inspector shows actual block details (ports, params, connections)
- [ ] Matrix shows meaningful block names
- [ ] Visual selection highlighting
- [ ] Click matrix cell → navigate to inspector

### Future: Port from v1
- Reference: `~/code/oscilla-animator_codex`
- Better inspector implementation
- Better matrix view
- Domain editor UI

## Outcome

**Blocking architecture work: COMPLETE**
**Usable UI: DEFERRED**

The React + MobX foundation is in place. UI features can be added incrementally or ported from v1 when priorities align.
