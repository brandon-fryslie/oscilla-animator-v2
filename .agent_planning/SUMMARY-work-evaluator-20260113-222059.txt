Scope: work/dual-editor-reactflow/P0
Verdict: INCOMPLETE (pending manual runtime verification)
Criteria: 11/11 code checks passing | Breaks found: 0 | Ambiguities: 0
Previous issues: N/A (first evaluation)
Missing checks: 2 recommended (E2E for EditorHandle, unit for adapter)
Cache updated: runtime-dual-editor-p0.md, INDEX.md

Code analysis confirms P0 implementation is structurally correct:
- Directory restructure complete (editor/ → reteEditor/)
- EditorHandle abstraction properly defined
- ReteEditor adapter implements interface correctly
- All imports updated in App.tsx, BlockLibrary.tsx, tests
- TypeScript passes (zero errors)
- P0-related tests pass (BlockLibrary 11/11)
- Pre-existing Hash Block test failures (3) unrelated to P0

Runtime verification required but cannot be performed without Chrome DevTools MCP.
User must manually verify at http://localhost:5177/:
1. Editor renders correctly
2. Block library double-click works
3. Pan/zoom operations function
4. Delete and connections work
5. No console errors

Risk: LOW - No breaking changes detected in code analysis
