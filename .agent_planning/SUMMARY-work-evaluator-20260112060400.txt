Scope: work/animation-deferred-work
Verdict: INCOMPLETE
Criteria: 0/3 functional groups verified | Code: 3/3 complete | Type Safety: PASS
Previous issues: N/A (first evaluation)
Missing checks: 3 E2E tests specified for functional verification
Cache updated: No updates needed (code verification only, no runtime findings)

Reason: All code changes are correct and complete, but functional acceptance 
criteria require runtime testing (browser access needed). User must verify:
1. Oscillator block renders without crash (sin/cos waveforms)
2. Circle block produces correct circular layout
3. Signal vs field size inputs work correctly
4. No console errors during playback

Code implementation: ✅ COMPLETE
Type safety: ✅ PASS (npm run typecheck clean)
Functional verification: ❓ BLOCKED (no browser access)
