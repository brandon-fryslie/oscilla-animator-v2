Status: in_progress

## Work Completed

### P0: Reusable MUI Control Components (COMPLETE)
- Created NumberInput.tsx with validation, clamping, blur/commit pattern
- Created TextInput.tsx with local state management
- Created SelectInput.tsx with FormControl wrapper and type-safe options
- Created CheckboxInput.tsx with integrated label support
- Created ColorInput.tsx with native picker, MUI styling, preview swatch
- Created barrel export index.ts for common components
- All components follow SliderWithInput pattern
- All support dark theme via theme.ts
- All use compact 'small' size variant by default

### P1: BlockInspector Migration (COMPLETE)
- Replaced all native HTML inputs with MUI components
- Migrated HintedControl switch cases to use new components
- Migrated ParamField inferred controls to use new components
- Added ThemeProvider wrapper to all inspector views
- Removed old wrapper component definitions (150+ lines)
- Removed unused style constants (inputStyle, selectStyle)
- Preserved all blur/commit behavior and validation logic
- Maintained parameter editing functionality
- Build succeeds, no new TypeScript errors

## Remaining Work

### P2: Button Migration (TODO)
- P2.1: Toolbar buttons → MUI Button
- P2.2: Tab navigation → MUI Tabs/Tab or Button
- P2.3: DiagnosticConsole filter buttons → MUI ToggleButton
- P2.4: ContinuityControls action buttons → MUI Button
- P2.5: Other buttons (search clear, auto-arrange, back) → MUI IconButton

### P3: ThemeProvider Consolidation (TODO)
- Check App.tsx for single ThemeProvider location
- Remove per-component ThemeProvider where possible
- Avoid nesting

### P4: Final Cleanup (TODO)
- Visual testing of all migrated controls
- Verify keyboard navigation works
- Verify dark theme consistency
- Document any breaking changes

## Verification Status

Build: PASS (vite build succeeds)
TypeCheck: Pre-existing test errors only (diagnostics tests)
Manual Testing: PENDING (requires dev server)
Visual Inspection: PENDING

## Notes

- All new components use MUI's dark theme from theme.ts
- Following architectural principle: ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH for component patterns
- SliderWithInput established the pattern, new components follow it
- No test regressions introduced (existing test failures are pre-existing)
- BlockInspector is the largest consumer of these controls, now fully migrated
- Ready to continue with P2 button migrations
