Scope: work/dual-editor-reactflow/P1
Verdict: INCOMPLETE
Criteria: 3/7 working (structural only) | Breaks found: 1 CRITICAL | Ambiguities: 1
Previous issues: N/A (first P1 evaluation)
Missing checks: 2 specified (custom node rendering, port connections)
Cache updated: runtime-dual-editor-reactflow-p1.md, INDEX.md

CRITICAL ISSUE:
  Custom node types missing - ReactFlow default nodes cannot render port-specific handles.
  Multi-port blocks will create connections with empty slotIds, breaking Oscilla semantic model.

FIXES NEEDED:
  1. Create OscillaNode.tsx component with Handle rendering (30 min)
  2. Register custom node type with ReactFlow (5 min)
  3. Update nodes.ts to use type: 'oscilla' (5 min)

AMBIGUITY:
  DOD defers "custom node styling" but custom nodes are functionally required for ports,
  not just cosmetic. Should have asked: "Are custom nodes needed for functionality vs appearance?"

ESTIMATED EFFORT: 1-2 hours to fix
