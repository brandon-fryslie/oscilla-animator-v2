Scope: work/path-foundation
Verdict: INCOMPLETE
Criteria: 7/8 working (code-verified) | Breaks found: 0 | Ambiguities: 0
Previous issues: N/A (fresh evaluation)
Missing checks: 3 specified (E2E, visual regression, unit tests)
Cache updated: No updates needed (no reusable runtime findings yet)

BLOCKER: 47 pre-existing type errors prevent runtime verification
  - Path implementation is TYPE-CLEAN (0 errors in path-specific code)
  - All DoD criteria satisfied in code except demo (requires `npm run dev`)
  - Tests passing (362/362)

-> PAUSE until typecheck fixed, then create demo
   Recommendation: Fix technical debt before continuing (2-4 hours)
   Alternative: Mark "COMPLETE (pending verification)" and defer
