Completed: Editable default sources in BlockInspector | Files: 1 | Commits: 1
Cache invalidated: None (new feature, no cache entries affected)
Status: complete

Implementation Summary:
- Added editable default source values in BlockInspector component
- Created DefaultSourceEditor component for editing constant defaults
- Updated PortItem to find and pass derived block to editor
- Maintained visual distinction (not connected label, different styling)
- Only constant defaults are editable (rail/none remain read-only)

Technical Details:
- Helper function getDerivedDefaultSourceId() matches pass1 pattern
- PortItem made observer to react to derived block param changes
- Edits call rootStore.patch.updateBlockParams(derivedBlockId, { value })
- MobX ensures UI reactivity, PatchStore handles persistence

Validation:
- TypeScript: 0 errors (npm run typecheck PASS)
- Architecture: Follows all primary constraints (single source of truth, single enforcer)
- Manual testing required: User should verify editing triggers recompile

Files Modified:
- src/ui/components/BlockInspector.tsx (+138 lines)

Commit: 63c01e8 - feat(ui): Make default source values editable in BlockInspector

Next Steps:
User should manually test:
1. Load app (npm run dev)
2. Select block with unconnected input
3. Edit default value in inspector
4. Verify visual output updates
