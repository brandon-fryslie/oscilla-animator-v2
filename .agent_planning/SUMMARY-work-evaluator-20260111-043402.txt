Scope: work/diagnostics-system/sprint-1
Verdict: INCOMPLETE (testing gaps)
Criteria: 15/15 working | Breaks found: 0 | Ambiguities: 0
Previous issues: All 10 gaps resolved
Missing checks: 4 specified
Cache updated: No updates needed (fresh implementation, no reusable findings yet)

=== Core Implementation: 100% Complete ===

All 15 acceptance criteria verified:
- Deliverable 1 (Core Types & EventHub): 5/5 ✅
- Deliverable 2 (DiagnosticHub): 5/5 ✅
- Deliverable 3 (Compiler & UI): 5/5 ✅

Files created: 17 new files (~2100 lines)
Files modified: 6 files
TypeScript: Zero errors (strict mode)
Tests: 201/202 pass (1 legacy API compatibility issue)

=== Blocking COMPLETE Status ===

Testing Gaps:
1. No automated performance test (DOD requires <10ms assertion)
2. No coverage measurement tool (DOD requires >80% verification)
3. 1 failing integration test (test structure issue, not bug)
4. Missing architecture README (DOD requires documentation)

=== What Works (Runtime Verified) ===

✅ EventHub: Synchronous, exception-isolated, type-safe
✅ DiagnosticHub: Five-event subscription, snapshot semantics correct
✅ TargetRef: 7 kinds, exhaustive checking enforced
✅ Diagnostic IDs: Deterministic, stable format
✅ Authoring validators: TimeRoot validation (O(n) performance)
✅ Compiler integration: Events emitted, errors converted
✅ UI: DiagnosticConsole reactive, displays correctly
✅ Data flow: Mutation → event → validators → UI (verified)

=== Recommendation ===

INCOMPLETE → COMPLETE after 4 fixes (1-2 hours):
1. Write architecture README (30 min)
2. Fix/delete failing integration test (15 min)
3. Add performance test with timing assertions (30 min)
4. Configure coverage measurement (15 min)

Core functionality is production-ready. Only testing infrastructure gaps remain.

Confidence: HIGH - Implementation follows spec precisely, no runtime issues found.
