# User Response: React Root Consolidation

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-10 20:35
**Status**: APPROVED

## Approved Plan Files
- PLAN-20260110-203000.md (updated)
- DOD-20260110-203000.md (updated)

## Critical User Requirements

1. **jsPanel4 Integration - MANDATORY**
   - Use custom fork from `~/code/brandon-fryslie_jsPanel4`
   - "Bake this so deeply into the app there is no way to get it out"
   - Use for absolutely everything
   - DO NOT remove jsPanel - it's core infrastructure

2. **Split Sidebar - BLOCKING USABILITY**
   - Left sidebar MUST show Library + Inspector simultaneously
   - "UI is literally not functional or usable until this is completed"
   - Split view with resizable divider
   - Both panels always visible (no tabs in left sidebar)

3. **Implementation Directive**
   - "OK go, implement, make it work"
   - Begin implementation immediately

## Sprint Deliverables

1. Single React root in main.ts
2. Entire page in React
3. jsPanel4 deeply integrated
4. Split sidebar (Library + Inspector always visible)
5. Tabs for center/right regions
6. Canvas integration preserved
