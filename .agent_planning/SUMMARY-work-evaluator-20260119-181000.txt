Scope: work/continuity-ui/core-controls
Verdict: INCOMPLETE
Criteria: 6/6 technical ✅, 5/6 functional ✅, 2/6 manual tests ⚠️ | Breaks found: 0 | Ambiguities: 0
Previous issues: N/A (first evaluation)
Missing checks: 1 E2E test specified
Cache updated: No new cache files (code-level verification only)

Reason for INCOMPLETE:
- All code implementation verified correct via thorough review
- TypeScript compiles, 372 tests pass
- Runtime behavior requires manual verification (E2E tools unavailable)
- User must verify 8 critical path tests (panel visibility, slider functionality, runtime effects)
- DoD requires visual confirmation of decay/tau effects during transitions

Next action: User must perform manual testing per evaluation document.
If all 8 tests pass → change verdict to COMPLETE.
