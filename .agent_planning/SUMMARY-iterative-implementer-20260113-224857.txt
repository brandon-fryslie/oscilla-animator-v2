## Work Completed

1. Created OscillaNode.tsx custom component
   - Renders Handle for each input/output port
   - Uses unique port IDs matching slot IDs
   - Dark theme styling consistent with app

2. Updated ReactFlowEditor.tsx
   - Added nodeTypes registration with useMemo
   - Imported OscillaNode component
   - Removed unused MiniMap import

3. Updated nodes.ts
   - Changed type from 'default' to 'oscilla' (line 35)

4. Verification
   - npm run typecheck: PASSED
   - All type errors resolved
   - Commit created successfully

## Impact

Fixes critical bug where:
- ReactFlow connections had undefined sourceHandle/targetHandle
- PatchStore edges had empty slotId: ''
- Multi-port blocks were completely non-functional

Now connections properly specify port IDs, enabling multi-port functionality.

- src/ui/reactFlowEditor/OscillaNode.tsx (NEW)
