Mode: manual
Completed: LogPanel integration | Files: 2 | Commits: 1
Tests: N/A - Pure integration task
Cache invalidated: None (Dockview pattern cache still valid)
Status: complete

Summary:
Successfully integrated LogPanel component into Dockview layout system. The LogPanel
component already existed but wasn't wired into the panel registry. Following the
established pattern, created a panel wrapper and registered it in the panel system.

Work Completed:
1. Created Dockview panel wrapper at src/ui/dockview/panels/LogPanel.tsx
2. Added LogPanel import to panelRegistry.ts
3. Added panel definition to PANEL_DEFINITIONS (bottom-left group)
4. Added component mapping to PANEL_COMPONENTS

Files Modified:
- src/ui/dockview/panels/LogPanel.tsx (NEW - 13 lines)
- src/ui/dockview/panelRegistry.ts (+3 lines)

Verification:
- TypeScript typecheck: PASS (no errors)
- Build: PASS (clean build)
- Pattern verification: Follows exact pattern of DiagnosticConsolePanel

Implementation Notes:
- No changes to defaultLayout.ts needed (declarative system handles it)
- Panel will auto-appear as second tab in bottom-left group
- Tab order: Console (first), Logs (second)
- Used import rename (LogPanel as LogPanelComponent) to avoid name collision

Acceptance Criteria Met:
✓ LogPanel wrapper created at correct path
✓ Registered in PANEL_DEFINITIONS with group 'bottom-left'
✓ Added to PANEL_COMPONENTS object
✓ Follows existing panel wrapper pattern
✓ TypeScript compiles without errors
✓ Build succeeds

Next Step:
User should verify in browser:
1. Bottom panel shows two tabs: "Console" and "Logs"
2. Clicking "Logs" tab displays the log panel
3. Any existing logs are visible
4. Panel is resizable
5. Can switch between tabs smoothly
