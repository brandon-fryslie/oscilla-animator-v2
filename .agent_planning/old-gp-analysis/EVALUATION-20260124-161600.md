# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — C-9 Complete, Sprint Closed
Timestamp: 2026-01-24T16:16:00Z
Git Branch: ralphie
Test Suite: 1277/1277 pass (3 skipped)

## Executive Summary
Overall: C-9 COMPLETE | Sprint p2-blocked RESOLVED for C-9 | C-8 and C-12 remain BLOCKED

The v1→v2 render pipeline migration (ms5.8) is fully complete. The v1 assembly path, v1 renderer methods, and v1 types have been removed. All tests pass on the canonical v2 path.

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Test suite | PASS | 1277/1277 green (3 skipped) |
| v2 assembly wired | PASS | ScheduleExecutor calls assembleRenderFrame() |
| v1 assembly removed | PASS | No assembleRenderPass in src/ |
| v1 renderer removed | PASS | No renderV1/renderPassIR in src/ |
| RenderFrameIR canonical | PASS | Renamed from _Future, version: 2, ops: DrawOp[] |
| SVG primitive support | PASS | renderDrawPrimitiveInstancesOp() added |
| 3D projection in v2 | PASS | assembleDrawPathInstancesOp handles camera |
| Type cleanup | PASS | RenderPassIR, ShapeDescriptor removed |

## C-9 Resolution

### Commits (ms5.8 switchover)
1. `523a1d1` - feat(render-v2): add 3D projection support to v2 render pipeline
2. `df39229` - feat(svg): add primitive rendering support to SVG renderer v2
3. `9dcf3cc` - Wire v2 frame assembly into ScheduleExecutor
4. `9e4a4c4` - Update tests for v2 RenderFrameIR_Future format
5. `d6b3510` - Migrate level5-10 projection tests to v2 render format
6. `e688b80` - refactor: remove v1 render code
7. `270d947` - refactor: rename v2 types to canonical names

### What Was Done
- Added 3D projection (camera → screenPosition/screenRadius/depth/compaction) to v2 assembler
- Added DrawPrimitiveInstancesOp support to SVGRenderer
- Switched ScheduleExecutor.executeFrame() from v1 to v2 assembly
- Migrated all test assertions from v1 (frame.passes[0]) to v2 (frame.ops[0])
- Removed all v1 code (assembleRenderPass, renderV1, renderPassIR, RenderPassIR types)
- Renamed RenderFrameIR_Future → RenderFrameIR, future-types.ts → types.ts
- Renamed assembleRenderFrame_v2 → assembleRenderFrame, renderFrameV2 → renderFrame

## Remaining Items

### C-8: EventPayload Design — BLOCKED
- Blocker: Architectural design needed (no event payload model exists)
- No actionable work possible without design decision
- Blocks: U-6 (SampleAndHold)

### C-12: PathStyle Blend/Layer — BLOCKED
- Blocker: U-21 (Layer system not designed)
- No actionable work possible without layer system
- Blocks: Nothing directly

## Sprint Status

The sprint `SPRINT-20260124-190000-p2-blocked` should be updated:
- C-9: DONE (was HIGH confidence, now complete)
- C-8: Still BLOCKED (LOW confidence)
- C-12: Still BLOCKED (LOW confidence)

## Verdict
- [x] Sprint C-9 work: COMPLETE
- [ ] Sprint overall: BLOCKED (C-8 and C-12 await design decisions)
- [ ] No further implementation work available in this sprint
