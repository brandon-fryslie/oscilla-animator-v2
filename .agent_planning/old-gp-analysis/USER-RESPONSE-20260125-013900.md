## Sprint Verdict

**APPROVED — Sprint COMPLETE**

All actionable critical items resolved:
- C-8: EventPayload infrastructure DONE
- C-9: Render pipeline v1→v2 migration DONE
- C-12: DEFERRED (blocked by U-21 layer system design, no action possible)

## Verification

- `npm run typecheck`: PASS (clean)
- `npm run test`: PASS (1284 tests, 3 skipped)

## Planning Status

Sprint P2-Blocked is closed as complete. No further gap-analysis critical sprints needed.

### Deferred Work

C-12 (PathStyle blend/layer) deferred to U-21 (layer system design). Will be addressed when layer system architecture is prioritized.

### Next Priorities

1. U-6 (SampleAndHold) — now unblocked, ready for implementation
2. P3 user decisions (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8) — pending user engagement
3. U-21 (layer system) — design work, unblocks C-12
