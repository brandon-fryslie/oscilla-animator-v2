# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Confirmed CLOSED (Routine Check)
Timestamp: 2026-01-29-000000
Git Commit: 108d2e9

## Executive Summary
Overall: CLOSED | Critical issues: 0 actionable | Tests: 1311 pass, 3 skipped | Typecheck: assumed clean (no code changes)

Routine re-evaluation confirms gap-analysis scope remains fully resolved. No regressions. No new critical items. No actionable work remains within this topic's scope.

## State Confirmation

### All Sprints Complete
| Sprint | Status |
|--------|--------|
| p2-blocked (C-8, C-9) | COMPLETE |
| stateful-primitives (U-4, U-5) | COMPLETE |
| utility-blocks (U-8) | COMPLETE |

### Critical Items Summary
- **P1 (12 items)**: ALL DONE
- **P2 (8 items)**: 7 DONE, 1 DEFERRED (C-12, blocked by U-21)
- **Actionable critical items**: 0

### Remaining Items (Out of Scope)
- **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): DEFERRED — blocked by U-21 (layer system). Separate topic.
- **P3** (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8): User decisions. Separate planning scope.
- **P4-P5** (27 items): Future features. Separate topics.
- **Trivial** (16 items): Cosmetic. No action.

## Verdict
- [x] COMPLETE - Gap-analysis scope fully resolved. Topic CLOSED. No new sprints needed.
- [ ] CONTINUE - N/A
- [ ] PAUSE - N/A

## Planning Recommendation
No new sprint plans needed for gap-analysis. All critical work resolved. Forward work belongs in dedicated topics:
- C-12 → `layer-system` topic (when U-21 is prioritized)
- P3 → Individual user-decision topics
- P4-P5 → Individual feature topics

## Closure Statement
Re-confirmed closure. This gap-analysis topic was comprehensively resolved across 3 sprints. The scope covered all P1 and P2 critical gaps between spec and implementation across topics 01-06, 16, and 17. All actionable items are done. The remaining deferred item (C-12) requires architectural work (U-21 layer system) that is tracked separately.
