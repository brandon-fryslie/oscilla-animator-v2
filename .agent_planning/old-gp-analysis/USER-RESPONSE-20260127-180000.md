## Status

**COMPLETE** — No actionable critical items remain.

## Summary

- All P1 critical items: RESOLVED (12/12)
- All P2 critical items: RESOLVED (7/8, C-12 correctly deferred)
- All sprints: COMPLETE (p2-blocked, stateful-primitives, utility-blocks)
- Test suite: 1311/1311 pass (3 skipped)
- Typecheck: Clean

## Decision

Gap-analysis topic is CLOSED. Remaining items (P3 user decisions, P4-P5 features) are outside gap-analysis scope and should be planned as separate roadmap features.

## Next Actions

- P3 decisions (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8): Require user input on architectural choices
- P4-P5 features (27 items): Plan as separate feature sprints
- C-12: Will unblock when U-21 (layer system) is designed and implemented
