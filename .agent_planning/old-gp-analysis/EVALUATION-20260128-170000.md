### Remaining Items (Not In Scope for gap-analysis)

- **P3** (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8): User decisions. Separate planning scope.
- **P4-P5** (27 items): Future features. Separate topics.
- **Trivial** (16 items): Cosmetic. No action.

## Verdict
- [x] COMPLETE - Gap-analysis scope fully resolved. Topic remains CLOSED.

- [ ] PAUSE - N/A

## Planning Recommendation
No new sprint plans needed for gap-analysis. All critical work resolved. Forward work belongs in dedicated topics:
- C-12 → `layer-system` topic (when U-21 is prioritized)
- P3 → Individual user-decision topics
- P4-P5 → Individual feature topics
