Status: AUTO-APPROVED (non-interactive session)

## Decision
Gap-analysis remains CLOSED. No actionable CRITICAL items exist. All P1/P2 work resolved.

## Confirmation
- Fresh evaluation confirms: 1311 tests pass, typecheck clean
- No regressions detected
- No new sprints needed — all sprint work complete
- C-12 remains correctly deferred (blocked by U-21 layer system)

## Forward Work (Separate Topics)
- C-12 → plan under `layer-system` when U-21 prioritized
- P3 user decisions → surface individually when relevant
- P4-P5 features → plan as individual topics
