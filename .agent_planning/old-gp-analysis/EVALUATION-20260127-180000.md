# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Final Status Confirmation
Timestamp: 2026-01-27-180000
Git Commit: 108d2e9

## Executive Summary
Overall: 100% complete (gap-analysis scope) | Critical issues: 0 actionable | Tests reliable: yes

The gap-analysis effort is COMPLETE. All planned sprints finished. All P1 and P2 critical items resolved (C-12 correctly deferred). No actionable work remains within the gap-analysis scope.

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| npm run test | PASS | 1311 passed, 3 skipped, 86 test files |
| npm run typecheck | PASS | Clean (tsc -b, zero output = zero errors) |
| Latest commit | 108d2e9 | feat(blocks): implement U-8 utility blocks |

## Sprint Completion Status

| Sprint | Status | Deliverables |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| p2-blocked (C-8, C-9 migration) | COMPLETE | EventPayload infra, v1->v2 render path |
| stateful-primitives (U-4, U-5) | COMPLETE | Lag, Phasor blocks |
| utility-blocks (U-8) | COMPLETE | Noise, Length, Normalize blocks |

## Findings

### Gap-Analysis Scope: COMPLETE

The gap-analysis identified and triaged all divergences between the canonical spec and implementation across topics 01-06, 16, 17. Results:

- **P1 (12 items)**: All resolved. No-dependency fixes applied.
- **P2 (8 items)**: 7 resolved, 1 deferred (C-12 PathStyle blend/layer, blocked by U-21 layer system).
- **P3 (4 items)**: Parked for user decisions. These are architectural choices, not bugs.
- **P4-P5 (27 items)**: Forward feature work. Not corrections.
- **Trivial (16 items)**: Cosmetic naming differences. No functional impact.

### What Remains Outside Gap-Analysis Scope

1. **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): Correctly deferred. Blocked by U-21 (layer system design). Adding fields without a consuming system would be dead code.
2. **P3 decisions** (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8): Require human judgment. Not bugs.
3. **P4-P5 features** (27 items): New capability. Should be planned as separate feature sprints via roadmap, not gap-analysis.

### Test Quality
Tests are genuine end-to-end (buildPatch -> compile -> executeFrame). No mocking of system under test. Edge cases covered. 1311 pass with 3 skipped (golden snapshot tests unrelated to gap-analysis).

## Ambiguities Found
None remaining. All ambiguities from prior evaluations have been resolved or documented with explicit design decisions.

## Recommendations
1. Close gap-analysis as an active topic
2. Transition remaining P3/P4/P5 items to roadmap-driven feature planning
3. No further evaluations of this topic needed unless new spec-implementation divergences are discovered

## Verdict
- [x] COMPLETE - All planned gap-analysis work is done. No actionable critical items remain. The topic should be closed.
- [ ] CONTINUE - N/A
- [ ] PAUSE - N/A

## Verification

Independently confirmed at evaluation time:
- Test suite: 1311 passed | 3 skipped (runtime output matches SUMMARY.md claim)
- Typecheck: Clean zero-error output
- All 3 sprints delivered their DOD acceptance criteria
- C-12 remains correctly deferred (PathStyle at src/render/types.ts lacks blend/layer, U-21 not implemented)
- USER-RESPONSE-20260127-000000.md explicitly marks gap-analysis as COMPLETE
