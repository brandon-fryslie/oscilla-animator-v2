# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Post U-8 Implementation

## Current State

- **All critical items (P1, P2)**: RESOLVED
- **Sprint utility-blocks (U-8)**: COMPLETE (Noise, Length, Normalize)
- **Sprint stateful-primitives**: COMPLETE (UnitDelay, SampleHold, Lag, Phasor)
- **Test suite**: 1311/1311 pass (3 skipped)
- **Typecheck**: Clean

## What Just Happened

U-8 utility blocks sprint completed successfully:
1. **Noise** — Deterministic procedural noise using OpCode.Hash with fixed seed
2. **Length** — Euclidean magnitude via component decomposition (x²+y²+z²→sqrt)
3. **Normalize** — Unit vector via division by length with epsilon guard

Design decision: Length/Normalize accept separate float components rather than packed vec2/vec3, sidestepping vector decomposition complexity in current IR.

## Remaining Work (Prioritized)

### Blocked
- **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer) — Blocked by U-21 layer system design. No functional impact.

### User Decisions Needed (P3)
- **R-2**: Keep Unit type system or revert to payload-only?
- **R-6**: Float64 vs Float32 for scalars?
- **R-7**: Stamp-based vs CacheKey caching?
- **R-8**: Expression trees vs op-level IR?

### Next Implementable Work (P4-P5)
Priority order:
1. **U-21** (Layer system) — Unblocks C-12, major renderer feature
2. **U-7** (PortBinding with CombineMode) — Unblocked by C-1
3. **U-26** (vec3 positions in coord system) → **U-27** (camera/projection)
4. **U-30/U-31** (Spiral/Random layout kernels) — Straightforward additions
5. Remaining compiler/runtime items (U-17, U-18, U-19, U-20, etc.)

## Verdict: CONTINUE

All critical work resolved. No blockers for forward progress. Next sprint candidates:
- Layout kernels (U-30, U-31) — HIGH confidence, straightforward
- PortBinding with CombineMode (U-7) — MEDIUM confidence, needs spec review
- Layer system (U-21) — LOW confidence, requires design exploration
