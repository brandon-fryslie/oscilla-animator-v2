# Evaluation: Gap Analysis
Timestamp: 2026-01-24-142424
Git Commit: 3bc32e6 (branch: ralphie)

## Executive Summary
Overall: STABLE | Critical issues: 0 actionable | Tests reliable: yes (1259/1259 pass)

No source code has changed since the prior evaluation (75462f7). All 3 remaining critical items (C-8, C-9, C-12) remain blocked by external architectural decisions. No new information has emerged to change their status.

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Vitest full suite | PASS | 1259 tests, 80 files, 10.39s |
| src/ diff since last eval | NONE | Zero file changes |
| EventPayload in src/ | ABSENT | Blocker for C-8 unresolved |
| ms5 epic beads | ALL OPEN | 10+ sub-tasks, none started |

## Missing Checks
None needed. The gap-analysis tracking is comprehensive and all actionable work is completed.

## Findings

### C-8: EventPayload (Runtime)
**Status**: BLOCKED (unchanged)
**Evidence**: `grep -r EventPayload src/` returns nothing. RuntimeState.ts:461 still uses `eventScalars: Uint8Array`.
**Blocker**: No architectural design for EventPayload type exists. No beads task tracks this design work.

### C-9: RenderPassIR Migration (Renderer)
**Status**: BLOCKED (unchanged)
**Evidence**: ScheduleExecutor.ts:99 still uses `kind: 'instances2d'`. future-types.ts defines target. Beads epic oscilla-animator-v2-ms5 and all sub-tasks (.4, .5, .7, .8, .11-.18) remain OPEN.
**Blocker**: Multi-task epic, no sub-tasks completed.

### C-12: PathStyle blend/layer (Renderer)
**Status**: BLOCKED (unchanged)
**Evidence**: future-types.ts:50 PathStyle lacks blend and layer fields. U-21 (layer system) has no design.
**Blocker**: Layer system architecture not designed.

### P3 Review Items (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8)
**Status**: PENDING USER DECISION (unchanged)
**Note**: These are design questions, not implementation gaps. No action can be taken without user input.

## Ambiguities Found
| Area | Question | How LLM Guessed | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| (none new) | All previously identified ambiguities remain unchanged | N/A | N/A |

## Recommendations
1. No action on gap-analysis critical items. All are genuinely blocked.
2. If progress is desired, work the ms5 epic sub-tasks (beads) to progressively unblock C-9.
3. C-8 needs an explicit design task created (no beads task tracks EventPayload design).
4. P3 review items need user decisions when convenient (no urgency).

## Verdict
- [x] CONTINUE - No actionable gap-analysis work exists. All blockers are real and tracked.

## Delta from Prior Evaluation (20260125-072200)
No material change. One commit (3bc32e6) touched only planning docs, not source. Test count unchanged. Blocker status unchanged. This evaluation confirms continued stability.
