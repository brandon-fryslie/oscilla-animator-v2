# User Response: Gap Analysis Final Update

## Decision: APPROVED

All critical items resolved. Gap-analysis planning updated to reflect completion state.

## Status

- All P1 critical items: DONE (12/12)
- All P2 critical items: DONE (C-12 deferred, blocked by U-21)
- Sprint stateful-primitives: COMPLETE
- Sprint utility-blocks: COMPLETE
- Test suite: 1311/1311 pass
- Typecheck: Clean

## No New Sprint Created

No new sprint was generated because:
1. All CRITICAL items are resolved
2. C-12 is blocked by U-21 (layer system design) — LOW confidence, requires design exploration
3. P3 items require human architectural decisions
4. Remaining P4-P5 items are enhancement-level features, not critical gaps

## Next Actions (When User Available)
- Solicit P3 decisions (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8)
- Plan U-30/U-31 layout kernels (HIGH confidence, ready)
- Plan U-21 layer system design (LOW confidence, needs exploration)
