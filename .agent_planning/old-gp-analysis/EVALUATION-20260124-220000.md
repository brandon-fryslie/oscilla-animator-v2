# Evaluation: Gap Analysis — Confirmation Run
Timestamp: 2026-01-24-220000
Git Commit: 07d8afd (branch: ralphie)

## Executive Summary
Overall: STABLE — no new actionable work | Tests: 1259 pass (80 files) | Critical remaining: 3 (all BLOCKED)

This is a confirmation run. All P1 critical items remain resolved. The one test failure reported in the prior evaluation (level1-vec3-data.test.ts using removed ConstColor) is now fixed. Full test suite passes clean. The remaining 3 critical items (C-8, C-9, C-12) are still blocked by their respective dependencies and cannot be acted on.

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| TypeScript typecheck | PASS (implicit via vitest) | No errors |
| Vitest full suite | PASS | 1259 tests, 80 files, all pass |
| Previously failing test | PASS | `level1-vec3-data.test.ts` — 14/14 pass |

## Changes Since Prior Evaluation (20260124-190000)
| Item | Was | Now | Reason |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| level1-vec3-data.test.ts | FAIL (ConstColor) | PASS | Test already fixed (uses Const block) |
| Critical topic files | Stale (listed resolved items) | Updated | Marked C-13, C-15, C-16 as resolved |

## Remaining Critical Items (unchanged)
1. **C-8** (EventPayload): BLOCKED — needs architectural design
2. **C-9** (RenderPassIR): BLOCKED — tracked as ms5 epic in beads
3. **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): BLOCKED — needs layer system (U-21) design

## Verdict
- [x] NO ACTION NEEDED — gap analysis is stable, no implementable critical items remain.

## Next Priorities (outside gap-analysis scope)
- ms5 epic sub-tasks in beads (unblocks C-9)
- Expression DSL (oscilla-animator-v2-3zd in beads)
- Render pipeline debt cleanup (oscilla-animator-v2-ms5)
