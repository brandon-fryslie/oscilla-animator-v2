Timestamp: 2026-01-27-230000
Git Commit: 108d2e9

## Executive Summary
Overall: 100% complete (gap-analysis scope) | Critical issues: 0 actionable | Tests reliable: yes

Gap-analysis is CLOSED. No actionable work remains. This evaluation confirms the final closure (20260127-220000).

## Runtime Check Results
| Check | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| npm run test | PASS | 1311 passed, 3 skipped, 86 test files |
| npm run typecheck | PASS | Clean (zero errors) |
| Latest commit | 108d2e9 | feat(blocks): implement U-8 utility blocks |

## Current State

### All Sprints Complete
| Sprint | Status | Deliverables |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| p2-blocked (C-8, C-9 migration) | COMPLETE | EventPayload infra, v1->v2 render path |
| stateful-primitives (U-4, U-5) | COMPLETE | Lag, Phasor blocks |
| utility-blocks (U-8) | COMPLETE | Noise, Length, Normalize blocks |

### Remaining Items (Not Actionable Within Gap-Analysis Scope)
- **C-12** (PathStyle blend/layer): DEFERRED — blocked by U-21 (layer system design). No functional impact.
- **P3** (R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8): User decisions required — separate planning scope.
- **P4-P5** (27 items): Forward feature work — separate planning scope.
- **Trivial** (16 items): Cosmetic, no action needed.

## Verdict
- [x] COMPLETE - Gap-analysis scope is fully resolved. Topic closed.
- [ ] CONTINUE - N/A
- [ ] PAUSE - N/A

## Recommendations
1. Gap-analysis topic is CLOSED — no further sprints needed
2. C-12 should be planned under a new topic (layer-system or U-21)
3. P3 user decisions should be surfaced when relevant features are planned
4. P4-P5 items become individual planning topics as needed
