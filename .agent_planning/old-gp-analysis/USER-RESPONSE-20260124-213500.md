# User Response: Gap Analysis — C-8 Complete, Sprint Updated
Timestamp: 2026-01-24T21:35:00Z
Status: AUTO-APPROVED (non-interactive session)

## Work Completed This Session

### C-8: EventPayload Design — DONE

Implemented spec-compliant EventPayload infrastructure:

1. Added `EventPayload { key: string, value: number }` type (commit 1e75e00)
2. Added `events: Map<number, EventPayload[]>` to ProgramState and RuntimeState
3. Clear events each frame (spec §6.1 compliance)
4. Wrote 7 EventPayload infrastructure tests (commit 46f26b9)
5. Maintained backward compatibility with eventScalars Uint8Array

Architecture: Dual-path (boolean flags + data-carrying Map)

Test suite: 1284/1284 pass (3 skipped)

## Sprint Status

- C-8: DONE ✅ (this session)
- C-9: DONE ✅ (prior session)
- C-12: BLOCKED (needs U-21 layer system design)

## Sprint Verdict

Sprint P2-Blocked is 2/3 complete. C-12 cannot be actioned without layer system design (U-21). Sprint should be considered effectively complete.

## Newly Unblocked

- U-6 (SampleAndHold block) — ready for implementation

## Planning Updated

- SUMMARY.md: Updated to reflect C-8 completion, new test count, dependency graph
- SPRINT-*-PLAN.md: C-8 marked DONE with commits and architecture notes
- SPRINT-*-DOD.md: C-8 criteria all checked, implementation notes added
- critical/topic-05-runtime.md: C-8 moved to resolved, item_count set to 0
- EVALUATION-20260124-213500.md: Fresh evaluation written
