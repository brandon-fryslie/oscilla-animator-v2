Completed: Block definition migration to Unit type system | Files: 2 | Commits: 1
Tests: N/A (manual validation via tsc)
Cache invalidated: None (no eval cache exists yet)
Status: complete

Migration Summary:
- Removed 'phase' and 'unit' from PayloadType union arrays in registry.ts
- Updated field-operations-blocks.ts to use canonicalType('float', unitPhase01()) instead of canonicalType('phase')
- Verified all production block files compile without errors
- Test files remain to be updated separately (per user instructions)

Key Pattern Applied:
  Old: canonicalType('phase')
  New: canonicalType('float', unitPhase01())

Files Modified:
- src/blocks/registry.ts: Removed 'phase'/'unit' from ALL_CONCRETE_PAYLOADS, STANDARD_NUMERIC_PAYLOADS, STANDARD_SCALAR_PAYLOADS
- src/blocks/field-operations-blocks.ts: Migrated phase inputs to use unitPhase01()

Verification:
- npx tsc --noEmit shows 0 errors in src/blocks/ production files
- Only test file errors remain (expected, to be handled separately)

Note: time-blocks.ts and signal-blocks.ts were already migrated in commit fc3bf7d
