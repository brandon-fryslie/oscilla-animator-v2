## Sprint Summary

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the foundational stateful primitive `UnitDelay` and add two missing "Basic 12" blocks (`Hash` and `Id01`) to enable feedback loops and deterministic per-element operations.

**Deliverables:**
1. **UnitDelay** - z^-1 delay block (foundation for all feedback)
2. **Hash** - Deterministic hash function for seeded randomness
3. **Id01** - Normalized element ID [0, 1) from domain

**Deferred:**
- Other stateful primitives (Lag, Phasor, SampleAndHold)
- Rail system implementation
- Block metadata/category system
- Block registry consolidation
- Noise, Length, Normalize blocks

## Next Step

Ready for implementation: `/do:it primitives-catalog`
