## Files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `references/summary.md` | **Start here** - Purpose, format explanation, and statistics |
| `references/project-structure.md` | Directory tree with line counts per file |
| `references/files.md` | All file contents (search with `## File: <path>`) |

## How to Use

### 1. Find file locations

Check `project-structure.md` for the directory tree:

```
src/
  index.ts (42 lines)
  utils/
    helpers.ts (128 lines)
```

### 2. Read file contents

Grep in `files.md` for the file path:

```
## File: src/utils/helpers.ts
```

### 3. Search for code

Grep in `files.md` for keywords:

```
function calculateTotal
```

## Common Use Cases

**Understand a feature:**
1. Search `project-structure.md` for related file names
2. Read the main implementation file in `files.md`
3. Search for imports/references to trace dependencies

**Debug an error:**
1. Grep the error message or class name in `files.md`
2. Check line counts in `project-structure.md` to find large files

**Find all usages:**
1. Grep function or variable name in `files.md`

## Tips

- Use line counts in `project-structure.md` to estimate file complexity
- Search `## File:` pattern to jump between files
- Check `summary.md` for excluded files, format details, and file statistics
