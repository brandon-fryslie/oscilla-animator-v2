Your exclusive job right now is to provide a recap of the most important unfinished / in-progress work.  It's critical that you provide this recap from what you know now, without using additional tools or reading additional files to generate the recap (you can use the Write tool to write it, if necessary).

The user may have intered more specific instructions.  If they did, go more in depth on that subject and include fine grained detail.  If the user gave you specific instructions or the recap is longer than ~20-30 lines, you must it to a file and provide the link.  

Please recap each of these topics:
- Any remaining work on current task
- Any remaining work on larger goal
- Any remaining deferred work you're aware of
- Any architectural or system level problems that caused bugs, interfered with your ability to implement work, or interfered with your ability to solve a problem
