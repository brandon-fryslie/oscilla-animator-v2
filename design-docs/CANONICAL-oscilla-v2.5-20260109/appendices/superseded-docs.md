## Using Archived Documents

The archived documents may be useful for:
- Understanding historical context
- Reviewing original phrasing
- Tracing how decisions evolved
- Comparing v2 vs v2.5 type system

They should **NOT** be used for:
- Current implementation guidance
- Authoritative definitions
- Design decisions
